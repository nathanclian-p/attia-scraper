In this episode from July 2022, Peter dives deep into the topic of bone health and explains why this is an important topic for everyone, from children to the elderly. He begins with an overview of bone mineral density, how it’s measured, how it changes over the course of life, and the variability between sexes largely due to changes in estrogen levels. From there he provides insights into ways that one can improve bone health, from exercise to nutrition supplements to drugs. Additionally, Peter discusses what happens when one may be forced to be sedentary (e.g., bedrest) and how you can work to minimize the damage during these periods.
While this original episode is an AMA, it is available in full to all listeners as a special rebroadcast.

Overview of bone health topics to be discussed [2:30]
Today’s episode is all things bone health: bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis, things of that nature
Why is this important?
Why should people care about this?
“
Our hope is in the beginning at least we’ll walk through why they should care about this and why they should focus on it early on in life
.”
We’ll talk about how bone health changes as people age, the differences between sexes in men and women
Then we’ll also focus on things on how people can improve or help their bone health become better from physical activity to nutrition, supplements, drugs, and more
Bones 101: bone function, structure, and more [6:15]
What is bone?
Bone is a living tissue
It’s easy to forget this fact and think of bone as somewhat inert
But bone is heavily vascularized
Bone is an organ that plays a very important role in a lot of things
Common bone types
Cortical/compact
bone is what forms the “shaft” and the exterior of long bones
Femur, humerus, etc. — they have the long shaft and then the nubbins at the end
The shaft of that is the cortical or compact bone
You also have the
trabecular bone/spongy bone
There are some differences amongst those in terms of their vascularization and things like that
For the purpose of this discussion…
when discussing the compact or cortical bone, Peter is referring to the shaft
And when speaking about the spongy/trabecular part, he’s talking about the end
Bone marrow
Marrow is important because it is what’s producing our white cells and our red blood cells
In a post COVID world, it’s important to understand that the memory B cells and memory T-cells that are going to provide lasting immunity against this virus and other viruses, reside in the bone marrow
The whole purpose of being infected and then having a subsequent infection that’s less devastating, (and purpose of being vaccinated) for the same reason is to have memory B cells and T-cells that are sitting there in the bone marrow that can respond immediately and quickly upon reintroduction of the same antigen
Bone mineral density (BMD), minerals in bone, role of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and more [9:30]
Osteoblasts and osteoclasts
Osteoblasts—“B” for blast
These are responsible for building bone by producing collagen bone matrix and mineralizing it
Osteoclasts
These remove bone by reabsorbing calcified bone and the matrix
So osteoblasts contribute to increasing bone mineral density
Osteoclasts the opposite
This exists in an equilibrium—We’re constantly remodeling bone, adding to and subtracting from this and basically turning over calcium
