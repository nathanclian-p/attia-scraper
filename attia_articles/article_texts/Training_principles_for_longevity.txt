Andy Galpin is a Professor of Kinesiology at California State University at Fullerton, where he studies muscle adaptation and applies his research to work with professional athletes. In this episode, Andy returns to the podcast and continues the conversation about training for longevity. He examines the training practices of powerlifters, Olympic weightlifters, Strongmen/women, CrossFit athletes, and sprinters in order to extract insights that can be applied to the individual wanting to optimize for longevity. Andy goes into detail about exercise load and repetition, training volume, the importance of learning proper movement patterns, the advantage of working to technical failure instead of the number of reps, and much more. Andy ties the discussion together by providing a hypothetical training plan for an individual wanting to optimize for longevity and offers advice for avoiding injury.

Review of the function and organization of skeletal muscle [3:15]
Let’s begin with a review of the major topics covered last time
The discussion last time was pretty technical; today’s discussion will be a little less so, but will assume that the viewer/ listener has some familiarity with what was talked about
What cells of muscles look like and how they function at the big, whole-muscle level
The term muscle refers to a collective group
For example, your quadriceps (thigh) is made of four muscles (that’s why it’s called a quad)
The biceps is multiple bicep muscles, orientation and insertion
In general, the way that humans move is, muscles will contract, and the end of muscles will come together to form a tendon
Those tendons connect to bone
When you contract muscle, it pulls that connective tissue (the tendon), that pulls the bone, and you move
You’ve got muscles throughout your body up and down, and they have different orientations, and they have different responsibilities
Some are meant to be what we call antigravity; this is to keep you up all day, and they don’t produce a lot of force for speed, but they’re meant to be non-fatigable
And others are the opposite, they provide explosion, power, propulsion
For example, consider the
calf muscles
; the
gastrocnemius
, that big one in the middle; if you point your toe to your face that pops out at you
That’s meant to be for power, sprinting, and jumping
The one that’s actually lower near
soleus
is meant to be on all day, so that you can stand, walk all day, and not get fatigued
This despite the fact that both of them come together to form the Achilles that wraps around the bottom of your heel, inserts the bottom of your foot, and that’s what makes your foot go up and down
In general, muscle is meant to create movement
Muscle actually does a lot of other things though that are vital to health, including
pumping fluid up and down
Because of gravity, blood will pull towards the lower part of your body
Muscle contraction is in large part what squeezes the blood back up into your heart, and into your lung
Muscle is the
amino acid reserve
That’s the place where you store amino acids, so that you can use them to create red blood cells, or immune cells, or anything else
Muscle is also the primary place actually where you
regulate blood glucose
, including glucose/ glycogen storage
Andy could go on and on, but muscle in general has a very important function in your body for movement as well as signaling
The last part to acknowledge here is, we typically will call muscle an
endocrine organ
, meaning it will send signals out through the body, through what are called
myokines
, or what some people will call
exerkines
(if they’re coming out as a responsive exercise)
That’s sending signal to your liver, or kidney, or brain, or lung, or anywhere else
At the level of the individual muscle
Each muscle is actually made up of billions, if not more individual muscle fibers
Muscle fibers or cells, myofiber, cell fiber ‒ these can be used interchangeably

Wikipedia
Muscle fibers are basically long cylinders
If you think about this like a ponytail
A ponytail is nothing but a collective, a whole bunch of individual hairs; and this is how you can think of skeletal muscle
Skeletal muscle
is a long, long cylinder; it is very strong
Cardiac
, and
smooth muscle
are quite different
The function of the muscle fiber is to contract
If you look at the whole muscle, it is surrounded by a bed of capillaries
As
blood goes into a muscle
, it comes in the big artery, then it’s going to go through a bunch of capillaries, and those capillaries are really surrounding, and mixing in and out that whole ponytail
Capillaries all over, and so they’re circulating around the individual fibers
That’s going to get you nutrients in (like glucose or anything else), and get waste products out (like carbon dioxide, etc.)
Visualize that big long cylinder, the capillaries are around it, and you have a whole bunch of
organelles
that do things
Probably the most pertinent is what are called
nuclei
, these are called
myonuclei
If you remember basic biology, the nucleus is what controls any cell
Most cells in the world have one nucleus, but skeletal muscle is unique, because there are an infinite number of nuclei spread throughout the duration of the muscle, and that gives you a lot of what we call plasticity
The more nuclei you have, the more control centers you have, the easier it is to respond to stressors, damage, adaptations, etc.
That’s why skeletal muscle is so adaptable to either good stimuli or bad stimuli
An example of bad stimuli would be the case of spaceflight, or physical inactivity
In addition to that are your
mitochondria
, and that’s what’s going to be able to produce a lot of your cellular energy
Finally, you’ve got what we call the contractile units
The things that make your muscle fibers
contract
together and squeeze on top of each other are
actin
, and
myosin
The figure below shows actin in green and myosin in purple
These are two molecules that reach up, the myosin grabs the actin, and pulls it together, smashes it literally on top of the cell
That’s why, when you flex a bicep muscle, it actually gains height, because you’re stacking things on top of each other, and that requires the muscle to go vertically

Review of muscle fiber types [9:30]
Can you explain, at that cellular level, what the difference is between the gastrocnemius and the soleus?
Earlier Andy drew a contrast between the soleus and the gastrocnemius, and alluded that one is slow to fatigue and one is fast to fatigue (the figure below identifies these muscles in the calf)
