In this special episode filmed live in front of readers of Outlive, Peter answers questions revolving around his concept of the centenarian decathlon. He starts by defining the “marginal decade” and how that shapes his training for the events and activities that make up his personal centenarian decathlon. Peter explains how he coaches patients through the challenges of customizing their own list and building out a training plan, including how to set fitness goals early in life in preparation for the marginal decade. From there, he dives into training within the four pillars (zone 2, VO2 max, stability, and strength), including the minimum effective dose, how to split your time, his personal protocols, and other considerations. Additionally, he touches on bone mineral density, female-specific considerations, working through injuries, and the profound impact training can have on the overall quality of life.

The best interventions for longevity [2:15]
Everyone who pre-ordered the book could sign up for this live event
They submitted a bunch of questions
The team went through thousands of questions and tried to group them and organize them to get through as many as possible
We apologize if we don’t answer your question
What’s the best thing you can do for longevity?
If you have five tactics in a tool kit, but if there’s just one thing people should focus on, what would that be?
This is an impossible question to answer because if you have a person who is sleeping four hours a night and you don’t fix that, nothing else will matter
Likewise, if you have a person who is malnourished, you have to address these issues
Generally speaking, if everything in your life is a 6 or 7 out of 10,
taking your exercise to a 10 out of 10
is going to have a “
greater impact on both the length and quality of your life than any of the other domains that I can think of
” says Peter
An exception would be emotional health; that’s one that can be such a binary thing
If you take a person who, for example, like Peter, where that house is not in order until that’s addressed, all the exercise in the world wouldn’t fix that either
The marginal decade and the centenarian decathlon [4:45]
Quickly define two terms we use quite a bit:
centenarian decathlon
and
marginal decade
The marginal decade is the last decade of your life
So everyone will have a marginal decade
Most people certainly don’t know the day they enter it
Sometimes, when you’re in it, especially if you’re nearing the end of it, a person probably has a sense of that appreciation
The marginal decade is an important model because for most people this is really a period of poor life quality
Physical health has usually declined significantly
Cognitive health potentially has declined as well
Peter has observed many people in their marginal decades (including people he’s been close to), and he noticed that there can be a great sense of withdrawal because of these things
They’re not participating in life
If you plan to have a remarkable marginal decade, by definition it means that all the decades that came before it also had to be pretty remarkable
In the
book
, Peter uses the analogy of an archer:
If you really want to be proficient at 50 yards with a bow and arrow, practice at 100
And you’ll be amazed at how simple 50 becomes and 60, and 70, and 80
It’s a very non-linear relationship in terms of accuracy with a bow and arrow
The centenarian decathlon becomes the scaffolding upon which Peter actually thinks of this
