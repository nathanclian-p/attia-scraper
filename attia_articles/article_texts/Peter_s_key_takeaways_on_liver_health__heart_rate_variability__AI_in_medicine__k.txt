In this quarterly podcast summary (QPS) episode, Peter summarizes his biggest takeaways from the last three months of guest interviews on the podcast. Peter shares key insights from each episode, covering diverse topics such as liver health with Julia Wattacheril, heart rate variability with Joel Jamieson, artificial intelligence with Zak Kohane, klotho for brain health with Dena Dubal, and lactate and lactate metabolism with George Brooks. Additionally, Peter shares any personal behavioral adjustments or modifications to his patient care practices that have arisen from these engaging discussions.

Overview of topics, and the positive feedback on the quarterly podcast summary format [2:00]
This is the second quarterly podcast summary we’ve done
We released the first one in June and received really positive feedback
In this conversation, we’re going to look recent episodes of
The Drive
and Peter will share
His key takeaways
Anything that has changed as a result
Be that his behavior or how he is thinking about things
In this episode we’ll cover topics such as the liver and liver health, heart rate variability and training, AI in medicine, klotho and Alzheimer’s disease, lactate, and more
Positive feedback
After the release of
QPS #1
, listeners expressed that they appreciated the recap of key takeaways from various episodes, which encouraged many to revisit or explore episodes they missed
They plan to make these summaries a regular feature
Julia Wattacheril episode: liver health and disease [4:00]
#302 – Confronting a metabolic epidemic: understanding liver health and how to prevent, diagnose, and manage MAFLD and liver disease | Julia Wattacheril, M.D., M.P.H.
(May 20, 2024)
***
Julia discussed liver health, liver disease (NAFLD, MASLD), everything as it relates to the liver
This was at times a technical episode
This is a classic episode of
The Drive
, meaning you don’t expect to turn on a podcast and walk into a graduate level seminar on the liver, but if you take a step back and think about it, we kind of need to
The liver is arguably one of the most important organs in the body
It is an organ for which we have no extracorporeal support
Meaning if your kidneys fail (God forbid, that’s very bad), at least you have the option of dialysis
If your lungs fail, at least you have a ventilator
Even if your heart temporarily fails, we have ways to support that outside the body
Remarkably we don’t have this for the liver
If a person goes into liver failure, their only solution is a liver transplant
And that speaks to the diversity and complexity of function in this organ
We talk about the function of the liver in 3 categories: metabolism, protein synthesis, and detoxification
There simply is no parallel for those things
Then talked about the role of alcohol
Everybody’s aware that alcohol is metabolized by the liver and therefore that excess alcohol is toxic
We talk a little bit about the how and the why
The metabolite of ethanol known as
acetaldehyde
basically causes all of the downstream problems by overwhelming the redox potential of cells in the liver
And that creates the attraction of free radicals and inflammatory cells
We did a great job talking about dose makes the poison here
So if a standard drink contains about 14-15 grams of ethanol, that will usually be found in about 12 ounces of a regular beer
Interestingly, Peter’s favorite beer contains 10% alcohol, and you would get that 14 g in far less volume
14-15 g ethanol is also contained in
5 oz. of wine contains
1.5 oz. liquor
Figure 1. Examples of a standard drink that contain 14 grams of alcohol

Wikipedia
It’s not intuitive for people to think about how many grams of ethanol they’re consuming
The
show notes
give more details on the toxicity of ethanol based on how many grams per day or grams per week you’re consuming
MASLD or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease
“
We talk about NAFLD, and that’s something that’s been talked about for the last 20 years. It’s the fastest growing form of liver disease in the developed world. And it’s probably poised in its long-term sequelae to be the leading indication for liver transplant within the next decade.
”‒ Peter Attia
The name has changed from NAFLD to
MASLD
to make the name more encompassing
NAFLD has the intuitive point of saying it’s a fatty liver disease that does not result from the consumption of alcohol because
AFLD (or alcoholic fatty liver disease)
would be the sister disease
This idea of MASLD (or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) speaks to the complete overlap of insulin resistance metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes
The overlap is so strong that Peter doesn’t know that it matters that much
According to Julia, 99.6% of people who meet criteria for NAFLD will also have the diagnosis of MASLD
The diagnosis is based on metabolic dysfunction
The key requirements for MASLD diagnosis
You have to have insulin resistance
It also requires that at least 5% of the hepatocytes (liver cells, it’s the functional unit of the liver) contain fat
But it does not require fibrosis
In this podcast Peter remembered things he once knew but had forgotten
The difference between kids and adults is the pattern of fibrosis they have
In
kids
, it’s more circulated around the portal vein
The portal vein is the vein that brings the majority of the nutrients to the liver
The portal vein is formed by the confluence of 2 enormous veins in the abdomen (the
superior mesenteric vein
and the
splenic vein
)
In that sense, the liver has 2 blood flows that are coming into it: 1 through the portal vein and 1 through the hepatic artery
The implication is what do you see from a diagnosis perspective, and in kids, you’re going to see an earlier increase in
ALT, AST and GGT
You often hear ALT, AST, and GGT referred to as liver function tests
We talk about how we accept that as terminology, but the reality of it is they really tell us nothing about liver function
They are enzymes that are associated with liver or hepatocyte health
When those enzymes go up, we generally understand that some sort of injury has taken place (we’ll talk about that more in a moment)
Pattern of fibrosis and steatosis in adults
In adults, the fibrosis and steatosis tends to occur closer to the central vein
As a result of that, you see a delay in the enzyme elevation
So what does that mean clinically?
It means that if you’re an adult and you’re developing steatosis and fibrosis, it could actually be taking place for quite a while before you see it
And that’s why
another huge takeawa
y (which we’ll get to in a moment) is that this reliance on
elevations of the transaminases
(which are the technical names for ALT and AST), and using that as your threshold for concern might be waiting a little bit too long
The top three causes of liver injury in the form of steatosis and fibrosis are:
#1 MASLD, followed by alcoholic liver disease, and finally, infections (hepatitis is the most common)
The fact that MASLD is now #1 is something that wasn’t even close to true 20, 30, 40 years ago
There is an older
episode with Chris Sonnenday
on organ transplantation that talks about the liver
In
Outlive
, Peter recounts a story when he was an intern more than 20 years ago doing pre-op on a patient
