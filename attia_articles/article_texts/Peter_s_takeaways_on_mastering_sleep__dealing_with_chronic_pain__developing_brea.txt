#339 – Unpacking trauma: How early wounds shape behavior and the path toward healing | Jeff English
(March 10, 2025)
***
This was an episode Peter really looked forward to doing
He has known Jeff for many years and owes him a great debt of gratitude
This is one of those episodes where between the time we recorded it and the time it came out was probably 8-10 weeks
During that period of time, Peter sent the unedited straight audio file of it to no fewer than 15-20 people
“
I couldn’t even wait for this episode to come out to be sharing it with people
.”‒ Peter Attia
That will be a record that will last for some time
There’s no scenario he can think of where he’s taken a podcast before it comes out and shared it with so many people
Most of the people he shared it with not only found it to be incredibly valuable, but actually wanted to sort of engage with Jeff on a professional level after that
It’s one of those podcasts where if it resonates with you, it’s really important, you’re going to share it a lot
This was a great episode about understanding trauma
It’s such a loaded word; it’s understandable why people might have some skepticism around that
The word does get used a little bit too much
Jeff has a great
definition
for it:
trauma is a moment of perceived helplessness that activates the limbic system
This can be a wounding event, a major event, or maybe a series of smaller events, and those typically get referred to as “big T” and “little t traumas”
A “big T” trauma is something really obvious, being the victim of a violent crime, for example
A “little t” traumas are like a thousand paper cuts, a parent that was there but just really wasn’t paying attention to their kid, and those can be damaging in different ways
With trauma, too often people focus on the “what happened” part of the equation, but he thinks that it’s more important to focus on the “how did I adapt” part of the equation
⇒
The
sine quo non
of trauma is that there’s a disconnected version of a person that shows up to life relying on maladaptive strategies to replace connection with something else
