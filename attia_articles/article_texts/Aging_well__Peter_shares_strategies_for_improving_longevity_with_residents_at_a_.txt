In this special episode of The Drive, Peter joins a unique conversation inspired by his daughter’s volunteer experience at a senior care center, where she formed meaningful relationships with residents curious about healthspan, lifespan, and strategies for living well as they age. Peter engages directly with the residents, covering critical topics like the profound impact of exercise—particularly strength training— for maintaining mobility, preventing falls, and preserving independence later in life. He also discusses the importance of nutrition, emphasizing adequate protein intake, along with strategies for sleep optimization and preservation of brain health. Peter also underscores the importance of emotional wellness, purpose, and social connections in healthy aging, provides advice on staving off chronic disease, and much more.

Show Notes
Peter’s definition of longevity [2:30]
Olivia is with her dad Peter and are here to talk about longevity
Over the summer Olivia volunteered at a senior living center called
Querencia
During that time she met Sally who was very interested in Peter’s work
Sally couldn’t join this episode because she’s sick, so this episode will be a conversation between Olivia and Peter for an audience at Querencia followed by their questions
The word longevity means different things to different people. When you talk about longevity, how are you defining it?
Definitely not living forever, although understandingly that’s what some people think of when they think of longevity
Peter is talking about it in terms of 2 things: lifespan and healthspan
The
lifespan
part is how long you live
This is what most people think of
The
healthspan
part is how well you live
Both of these are of equal importance, and an extreme of one without the other is not ideal
Nobody is saying, “
I’d love to live to 100, but I want to spend the last 20 of those years unable to move
.”
Similarly no one would think it’s ideal to live an amazing, healthy live, but having that life cut short prematurely at 50
“
When I think of longevity, what I’m really thinking about is maximizing both the length of life and the quality of life
.”‒ Peter Attia
Quality could further be broken down into a physical piece
Am I free of pain most of the time?
Am I able to physically do the things I enjoy doing?
That could range from just the activities of daily living and self-care to recreational activities
If you like to garden, how long do you want to be able to do that?
If you play golf, if you like to go for walks and hikes or swim
Then there’s a cognitive piece
Peter doesn’t think anybody would fully expect that his brain (at his age) is as sharp as Olivia’s is, but he still wants to believe that his mind is pretty sharp
We all want that for as long as possible
The final piece is an emotional piece
That deals with happiness, sense of purpose, connection to others
You can imagine a scenario where somebody has perfect physical healthspan, meaning they can do anything they want to do physically, their brain is sharp, but they have no friends and no relationships
We would all agree that that’s not really an ideal life
Nobody would aspire to that
When you put all those things together, that’s what longevity is
Why it’s never too late to invest in your longevity [5:30]
If some people here are wondering, is it too late to start caring about longevity and living longer, what would you say to them?
That is not the case
On the one hand, the earlier a person begins to take steps to increase their longevity, the more opportunity they have
It’s like investing
When is the best time to start saving for retirement?
Probably the minute you start earning your first paycheck in your teens or 20s
But does that mean you shouldn’t save money when you’re older? No, it doesn’t
What the data say
Data from clinical trials that are done with seniors that demonstrate for example: people who have never lifted weights in their life before, who start lifting weights for the first time when they’re in their 60s and 70s, have a remarkable benefit
This is not just true of weight training; it’s true of any sort of exercise
The short answer is no, it’s never too late to really start thinking about this, but obviously the best time to plant the tree is yesterday, if not today
Olivia asks, “
Why do they have a benefit if they haven’t done it before?
”
There’s an effect of training
Specifically thinking of exercise, the body is really a “use-it-or-lose-it” organ (or collection of organs)
And the muscles are a great example of that
It’s actually true of young people and old people
⇒
The greatest effect of exercise is generally seen in the person who goes from being completely sedentary to even a mild amount of training
If you look at somebody who exercises all the time ‒ if they added 3 hours a week to their training, it wouldn’t have an enormous impact
Like Peter or Olivia
If you took an individual who did zero exercise, and you took them to 3 hours a week, the impact is enormous
Let’s be honest, 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week, is not a huge ask
The importance of adding “life to years” rather than just “years to life” [7:45]
Can you talk about the importance of adding life to years rather than just years to life and what that means to you?
