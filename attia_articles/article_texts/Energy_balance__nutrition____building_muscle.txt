#163 – Building muscle, losing fat, and the importance of resistance training
(May 2, 2022)
#205 – Energy balance, nutrition, & building muscle
Layne Norton holds a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences and is a physique coach, natural bodybuilder, and
previous guest on The Drive
. In the first half of this episode, Layne dives deep into the topic of energy balance, including the role that macronutrients and calories play in weight loss. He describes how many people struggle with tracking food and calories on their own across a variety of diets and how all of this can impact nutritional habits and behaviors. In the second half of the episode, Layne discusses the importance of protein and weightlifting for improving one’s body composition and increasing muscle mass. He explains how he would prescribe different training and nutrition programs for two hypothetical clients—a 50-year-old female who is entering menopause and wants to improve her health, and a 40-to-50-year-old male who wants to maximize muscle mass. Additionally, Layne discusses a number of supplements that could potentially benefit a training program including whey protein, branch chain amino acids, creatine, nitric oxide boosters, and more.

Defining energy balance and the role of calories [2:30]
Most people think
energy balance
is about tracking calories in and calories out
If I burn 250 calories a day and eat 2000 calories then I should lose 1 lb a week
When this doesn’t happen they say, “
this doesn’t work
”, and there’s a lot of different reasons for this (we’ll come back to later)
Energy balance is calories in versus calories out (energy consumed and energy spent)
What is energy?
A lot of people say calories don’t exist, you can’t see them under a microscope
We’re talking about energy stored in the chemical bonds of food
When food is broken down these molecules go through metabolism: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle (shows in the figure below)
Energy is liberated in these cycle but captured mostly as ATP
ATP is our high-energy phosphate

How energy is stored
But you can’t store a bunch of
ATP
because it is an unstable molecule
We have evolved to store fat in adipose tissue; this is a store of excess energy
You can store some energy in glycogen
Layne argues that you can’t really store energy as protein
Some claim that you can break down lean tissue but to him this is like saying, “
Let’s build a house so it’s a reservoir for wood
”
The contribution of
glycogen
to your relative energy stores, it’s actually really small
About 1500 to 2000 calories of energy
So your adipose tissue is by far the biggest energy store
It’s economical for space because you can fit a large amount of lipid/fat in a small area
It’s energy dense
It’s relatively easy to convert fat to ATP
Glycogen has to track with a lot of water; it’s not an efficient way to store energy
Defining a calorie, whether they are all created equal, and how much energy you can extract from the food you eat [8:00]
Calories
are literally a measurement of energy
It’s just a unit of measurement
When people ask, “
Aren’t all calories created equal?”
That’s like saying, “
Are different notches on your speedometer different?
”
Think of calories as the energy stored in chemical bonds that can be transferred through various metabolic processes
Metabolism is simply trying to capture the metabolizable energy in food
One important caveat— not everything in food is metabolizable, especially with regards to
fiber
and specifically insoluble fiber
It used to be thought that insoluble fiber can’t be digested at all, that it contributes zero calories
Now there is some evidence that our gut microbiome can extract some calories from insoluble fiber
Work by
Suzanne Devkota
shows this, maybe 1-4 calories per gram
4 calories per gram is the normal amount found in carbohydrates
Food component
Calories/ gram
(or kcal/g)
Polyols (sugar alcohols, sweeteners)
2.4
Organic acids
3
Carbohydrate
4
Protein
4
Alcohol (ethanol)
7
Fat
9
So the big C (calorie) = 1000 little c (calories) or kcal (kilocalories)
Most people say they eat 2000 calories but in realities this is 2000 kcal
A calorie is defined as
the energy needed to heat 1 gram of water from 14.5 to 15.5-degrees Celsius at 1 atmosphere
Normally we would think of a
joule
as a unit of energy
It’s also important to point out the
conservation of energy
as it changes forms
The energy in food is stored in its chemical bonds (chemical energy)
This is turned into electrical energy via the
electron transport chain
(shown in the earlier figure)
Then we turn it back into chemical energy with the generation of
ATP
(at the end of the electron transport chain)
ADP + P
i
+ free energy → ATP + H
2
O
The phosphate bond created between ADP and inorganic phosphate (P
i
) stores energy
This energy is transferred to a hydrocarbon with the production of fatty acids; reactions are coupled to ATP hydrolysis to transfer energy to another bond
ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP + H
2
O → ADP + P
i
+ free energy
Carbon-hydrogen bonds are the most energy dense bonds in our body, more so than carbon-oxygen bonds
Fatty acids
are long chains of carbons and hydrogens; this is why fatty acids have more calories per g than carbohydrates
Carbohydrates
have more oxygens; see the figure below
Figure 2. Comparing the composition of a fatty acid to the carbohydrate glucose.

Wikipedia
Fats, through
beta-oxidation
are broken down in 2-carbon units to directly create Acetyl-CoA which goes directly into the Krebs cycle
For glucose, there’s a lot more involved to generate ATP
Glucose does have benefits in terms of the amount of oxygen required [is less] to generate the same ATP
Peter notes, “
you can really liberate different amounts of energy from the same foods, depending on many things, but presumably based on your gut microbiome. That’s probably one of the things that’s going to create a pretty sizable delta when it comes to how much food you’re capturing. In other words, how much of that chemical energy you are able to recoup and repurpose into electrical energy.
”
Layne agrees, there is evidence that the gut microflora in people prone to obesity are better able to extract energy from the foods they eat
This could be reverse causation, that the diet these obese people eat causes these types of gut microfloa to grow and so forth
You have to be careful about establishing correlation versus causation
It is possible to assess how much energy is lost in fecal matter
It’s usually 5-10%; this accounts for 95% of people but there is variation
So for the vast majority of people, differences in calories extracted by gut microflora isn’t going to cause a significant difference (only for a few outliers)
There is some variability in the amount of energy you can extract from the food you eat
