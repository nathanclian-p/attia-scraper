In this special episode of The Drive, we have pulled together a variety of clips from previous podcasts about
exercise
to help listeners understand this topic more deeply, as well as to identify previous episodes which may be of interest. In this episode, Peter discusses his framework for exercise, what he’s really optimizing for, and how to train today to be prepared for a good life at age 100. He describes the importance of strength and stability, and why deadlifting is an important tool to consider for longevity. Additionally, he details why training in zone 2 and zone 5 is important, gives a primer on VO2 max, and describes the most effective ways to engage in those types of exercise. Finally, Peter reveals his current exercise routine.

What is Peter optimizing for with his exercise? [3:00]
From episode
#92 – AMA #12: Strategies for longevity (which don’t require a doctor)
; discussed from [30:30] – [33:45]
Peter is looking at exercise through the lens of longevity, not performance
The difference is important
If your goal was to break 2 hours and 40 minutes on the Chicago Marathon next year, the training required would be totally different from that needed to maximize longevity
Longevity is a very difficult performance goal
When you start to look into the far recesses of amazing physical performance, training would be very specific for that
This is not what Peter is discussing
Training for this type of performance is generally not collinear with longevity and at times they can be outright orthogonal
So this is the difference between something being in-line with (collinear) or at-odds with (orthogonal)
Exceptional physical performances requires maximum cardiac output, just beneath
VO
2
max
This level of performance and training puts an amazing strain on the body
While this is better than sitting on the couch all day, it is past the point of optimizing longevity returns
This comes at some longevity cost relative to training at a lower energy system
Why training for the “Centenarian Decathlon” is so important
This podcast is geared toward this “Centenarian Decathlon”
“
This is the idea of being the most kick-ass 90-year old possible
”‒ Peter Attia
This is based on 2 energy systems:
1 – Strength and stability
2 – Low-end aerobic energy system (which is zone 2, we’ll talk about that in a moment) which is punctuated with brief bursts of zone 5
These energy systems matter because this is generally where life takes place
“
Life is zone 1, zone 2, and zone 5
”‒ Peter Attia
By training in zone 2 and zone 5 (with much more focus on zone 2), we’re preparing metabolically and structurally for longevity
Preparing for a good life at age 100: Training for the “Centenarian Decathlon” [6:00]
From episode
#50 – AMA #5: calcium scores, centenarian Decathlon, exercise, muscle glycogen, keto, and more
; discussed from [18:15] – [33:45]
What does Peter wish he incorporated into his exercise at age 25 to be in this race for the gold medal in the “Centenarian Decathlon”?
For most people, a system of the body is going to fail first
Some people die suddenly when their mind and body are fine; they are an exception to this discussion
For many people their mind fails first, cognition is taken from them and then eventually they die or their body breaks down
For most people, the decline of mind and body, and the burden of disease occurs as the body fails first
This prompted Peter to think about how to mitigate the decline / fail of the body
He engaged in
backcasting
(instead of forecasting), to think of what he wants to do when he is 100 and work backwards from that to determine what to do today at age 45 (or any age)
He borrowed the term backcasting from
Annie Duke
who wrote
Thinking in Bets
See
episode #60 with Annie Duke
This led to the question‒
What do I have to physically be able to do to be satisfied with my life at 100 years old?
He thought about how old his kids would be when he is 100, and how old will their kids be
He realized at this age, his grandkids will have kids
When Peter is 100, he will likely have great-grandchildren that are between the ages of 1-8
What will Peter want to be able to do at 100 to be happy?
He doesn’t want to be bedridden with disease
He wants to retain his cognitive faculties
There are lots of physical activities he want to be able to do
Shoot a bow and arrow
Exercise (he enjoys it)
Activities of daily living
are important
Things he would want to do with his great-grandkids when they are 1, 3, 4, 5, etc.
Be able to drop into a squat position and pick up a child that weighs 30 lbs
Be able to get up off the floor using a single point of support, such as just 1 arm
Be able to lift something that weighs 30 lbs over his head; this is about the weight of his carry-on suitcase
Be able to get out of a pool without a ladder
Be able to walk up 3 flights of stairs with 10 lbs of groceries in each hand
He made a list of 18 things‒ this became his centenarian decathlon (even though a decathlon is only 10 things)
He asked‒
What are physical tasks that will approximate the things he wants to be able to do for daily living at age 100?
