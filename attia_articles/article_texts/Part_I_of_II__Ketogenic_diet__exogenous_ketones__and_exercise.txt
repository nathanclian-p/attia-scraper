AMA with Dom D’Agostino, Ph.D., Part I of II: Ketogenic diet, exogenous ketones, and exercise
(July 20, 2020)
AMA with Dom D’Agostino, Ph.D., Part II of II: Ketosis for cancer and chronic disease, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and the effect of ketosis on female health
Back by very popular demand for a special AMA episode,
ketosis
expert Dom D’Agostino joins Bob Kaplan, Peter’s Head of Research, to address many lingering questions about the ketogenic diet,
exogenous ketones
, and exercise for overall health. Dom also shares valuable insights from his personal experience with training, supplements, intermittent fasting, and other nutritional strategies to optimize his own health and performance.

Dom’s recent and ongoing projects [3:00]
The main objective in last 2 years
: Trying to move the laboratory science into human applications
Projects
:
NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations
research
Dom was a crew member for
NEEMO 22
His wife was a crew member for
NEEMO 23
This project is evaluating the effects of hyperbaric environments, extreme environments on human physiology
They now have an IRB protocol for cognitive function, body composition, gut microbiome, sleep, heart rate variability, and stress
Effects of ketones on cancer cachexia
They are looking at the effects of ketones on mitigating cancer
cachexia
and wasting associated with metastatic cancer
Dom just
published a manuscript
Metabolic therapies for various genetic diseases
Example being
Kabuki syndrome
They are developing ketone metabolic therapies as a means to treat these diseases not only from a metabolic perspective, but as a means to influence epigenetic pathways that may be used to treat the disease
Ketones may be a form of metabolic
“epigenetic therapy” for genetic disorders like Kabuki syndrome
Benefits of a ketogenic diet for an otherwise healthy person [7:00]
Intermittent ketosis
The main benefit is that it promotes
metabolic flexibility
Most people are adapted to frequent carbohydrate feedings
And they are not adapted to using fat as a major energy source during times of limited carbohydrate availability or calorie availability during periods of fasting
Ketosis (and/or fasting) activates a genetic program that allows you to burn fat and make ketones more efficiently
It may take some time, but you have an innate ability to be metabolically flexible, so the more you do intermittent ketosis (or fasting), the more benefits you derive from it over time
Glucose-ketone index and insulin suppression
⇒
The glucose ketone index calculator: a simple tool to monitor therapeutic efficacy for metabolic management of brain cancer
The thing to target would be the
glucose-ketone index
For example, you could restrict calories by 50% on a ketogenic diet and do that for six days a month and achieve, a
glucose-ketone index between 1 and 2
Insulin suppression also occurs
Doing a restricted ketogenic diet combined that with time-restricted feeding, you’re hitting all the major drivers of the benefits that you’d get from fasting such as:
suppressed mTOR
suppressed insulin
It’s also probably stimulating autophagy
*Suggestion from Dom
: Once a month, try to do 5-7 days of a ketogenic diet restricting calories by 50%
Book recommendations for getting knowledgeable on the ketogenic diet [11:30]
