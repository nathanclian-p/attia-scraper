In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter answers a number of questions on optimizing sleep. He describes his pre-bedtime routine, how he utilizes a sauna, and his current regimen of medicines and supplements for improving sleep time and quality. He goes in depth on each of the molecules that have shown promise in boosting sleep, including their mechanisms of action as well as any noteworthy contraindications. Peter also discusses sleep wearables, including both the positives and potential negatives of using such trackers, and much more.

Peter’s current pre-bedtime routine [3:30]
⇒ Peter recently
shared
a bit about his bedtime routine on instagram
What does Peter’s current pre-bedtime routine consist of?
The following is the result of many years of tinkering
And a lot of these insights are not necessarily new, but it’s just a question of being diligent around putting them in place
1 – Alcohol
It’s very difficult to have a good night’s sleep if you have alcohol in the proximity of bedtime, or even if you have two or three drinks several hours removed from bedtime
The negative effects manifest itself in a number of ways, but probably most notably is the reduction in the
quality of sleep
You’ll trade more deep sleep and REM sleep for light sleep
And there will be much more frequent wake ups
2 – Eating too close to bed
Peter discovered when fasting the profound positive impact of the low glucose/empty stomach on sleep
He was amazed how, when fasting, his sleep quality improved in ways that he’s never seen before
Peter generally eats dinner early in the evening
And he will notice that when he goes to bed, he’s a little bit hungry (in the past he would have a snack but not he doesn’t)
Peter strives for about three hours between his last meal and when he goes to bed
3 – Sauna
About 7 years ago, when doing a deep dive into sauna literature, he came to the conclusion that there was really no benefit to sauna that wasn’t captured in a
healthy user bias
By this he means that all of the epidemiologic benefits associated with sauna (such as an enormous reduction in cardiovascular mortality and mortality associated with dementia) seemed to be mostly a healthy user bias
But in late 2019/early 2020 he
revisited the literature
and changed his tune a little bit
He still thinks that maybe the
magnitudes
of the benefits associated with sauna are being amplified by these biases that can’t be controlled for, but the direction of them & the consistency of them across studies led him to believe there’s probably something there in addition to the plausibility of the mechanisms
Today, Peter personally does sauna 4-6 nights per week before bed basically for two purposes
1 – He believes there is at least SOME mortality benefit that comes from it
2 – Improving sleep – “empirically the impact this has had on my sleep is insane”
Peter has often wondered if the mortality benefit of sauna is largely attributed to the sleep benefits that come from its use
*Important note of clarification about the 3 principles listed above
:
These are general principles that are going to get violated quite often, but you want to kind of revert back to them whenever you can
With sleep in particular, there’s such a psychological component to this that you just don’t want to get too wrapped up in your head about this sort of stuff because that can cause more harm than good
Interpret what he’s saying as guidelines that we try to stick to, but we have the flexibility to deviate
(see
AMA #41
for tips on prioritizing healthy habits while navigating the stresses of life)

Sauna: Peter’s routine, sleep benefits, and tradeoffs [10:45]
What’s your current view on sauna use in terms of risk reward?
It depends on the individual, say Peter
There are probably some people who would need to consult with their doctors before getting into a sauna
It is very hot inside a sauna (Peter keeps his at 198 degrees Fahrenheit)
Peter’s typical routine is 15 minutes and then a cold plunge and then 20 to 25 minutes
By the end of that second stint in the sauna, Peter is quite taxed and there’s a subset of the population for whom that might be a little too taxing
Outside of that, the biggest risk of sauna is probably having accidents in saunas like falling
Opportunity cost
But like anything else, it comes at an opportunity cost
For instance, Peter’s routine takes him about 1 hour
The question becomes, is there something better you can be doing in that hour for your physical or mental health?
For some people that opportunity cost might be too high
Maybe it’s taking them away from an hour of sleep that they otherwise need
Each person needs to figure out what they’re giving up for that amount of time
Financial cost –
These saunas are expensive to put in your home, so there’s a financial cost there
These risks/costs need to be weighed against the “benefits”
Some benefits are “soft” such as maybe it’s an opportunity time to spend with your spouse (Peter and his wife do the sauna together)
Improvement of sleep is a tangible way to assess benefit if you fall in the camp of people who sleep is improved by that
As far as the hard numbers around the reduction in mortality, Peter says…
“I’d be hard pressed to believe that they are as strong as they are demonstrated in the finished data sets. . .But if they’re half that, they’re still pretty good”
Note that Peter wouldn’t rate sauna nearly as valuable as exercise  – “
An hour of exercise is better for you than an hour of sauna if you’re really playing the game of inches
”
Peter’s view on dry sauna and infrared sauna
Peter says it’s unclear if infrared and dry have the same benefits
It’s a very different mechanism
And they produce a very different feeling if you’re in them
The literature is mostly on dry saunas
The infrared devices relatively inexpensive, relatively small, such that if you live in a tiny apartment, you could still have one
Peter says he still thinks there is a benefit to infrared but it’s going to be much more difficult to quantify by attribution to the literature
Warm bath/shower
For those people who don’t have access, can’t get access, even a warm bath or even a hot shower can still have some of those sleep benefits that it’s worth people testing before they go to bed
“
The broader theme around sleep is you have to try things several times and realize if they work for you or not
