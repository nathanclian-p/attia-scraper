Gary Taubes is an investigative science and health journalist and a best-selling author. In this podcast, Gary explains how he developed a healthy skepticism for science as he was transitioning from being a physics major to beginning as a science journalist. He talks about how he was particularly drawn to sussing out “pathologic science,” telling the stories behind his books on the discovery of the W and Z bosons and cold fusion, emphasizing the need for researchers to perform a thorough background analysis. Gary then describes how his work came to focus on public health, nutrition, and obesity.  He provides a great historic overview of obesity research and provides his explanation for why the conventional wisdom today is incorrect.

Gary’s background in science and journalism, and developing a healthy skepticism for science [2:20]
Gary began in the hard sciences
majored in applied physics at Harvard
Growing up in the 1960s, he read science fiction and wanted to be an astronaut
Was also competing with older brother who studied physics
But “
Hamiltonian
was beyond my ability to comprehend,” so he did not pursue physics after college
Instead he got a Master’s in aerospace engineering at Stanford
Realized he wouldn’t be chosen as an astronaut over shorter, lighter candidates who were in better shape
Also realized that he “wouldn’t survive very well in any kind of military hierarchy that required blind acknowledgement to superiors”
Where was that seed planted of insatiable skepticism and a refusal to bend to authority?
He switched from science to journalism
When his son plays basketball, Gary notices that the best players are the ones who have older brothers who play
On some level, Gary’s competition with his brother started his skepticism
he went to journalism school at Columbia to become an investigative journalist
Was fascinated by
All the President’s Men
by
Bob Woodward
and
Carl Bernstein
After journalism school he took a job at
Discover Magazine
He did a
piece
on the
Shroud of Turin
the supposed burial shroud of Christ appeared in the historical record right around the 11th or 12th century when there a big market in fake religious artifacts
Researchers from Los Alamos took their high-tech imaging equipment to Turin to examine the shroud
they said they didn’t understand how it was made, even though it had been carbon-dated to the 11th and 12th century
He thought their conclusions were not supported by the data
“There’s nothing fundamentally different about somebody who goes into science and somebody who goes into journalism, other than we have sort of different mechanisms of wanting to understand what truth is.” —Gary Taubes
If they were unable to determine how the shroud was created, don’t have to conclude it was made by supernatural means
it could mean that the equipment used was simply inadequate
Today, we’re almost having the same debate about the cause of obesity:
Are you doing the right experiments?
Have you refuted the hypothesis, or are the experiments flawed?
And that’s always a fundamental issue in science
Gary’s boxing experience, and the challenge of appreciating behavioral risk [8:40]
The challenge of appreciating behavior risk
Gary started smoking in 1978 when he was depressed
struggled with the transition from undergrad to grad school where no one knew him
Took him 20 years to quit
As he and Peter discussed in their work with the
Nutrition Science Initiative
(NuSI), kids rarely think in terms of the things they do being dangerous
He and Peter both boxed, but Peter never considered it dangerous (“I had this true mental block”)
When he was 20, Peter suffered a very severe concussion from boxing
hospitalized for two days, had significant bruising and cerebral contusions, and a headache that lasted for three months
took him that long to realize how dangerous it was
Gary’s college friend was killed in a boxing match their senior year
Nevertheless, Gary still started to box 3 year later
“I never thought that what happened to him could happen to me until I got knocked out in the Golden Gloves. . At which point, there’s this awareness when you get knocked unconscious, when you wake up that some people never wake up from that.”
“I always thought it was fascinating that the less life we have left to live, the more risk adverse we become.” —Gary Taubes
Lessons in boxing
It’s hard to make young people understand prevention of chronic illness, disease, and addiction
Gary is sure behavioral psychologists like
Daniel Kahneman
and
Amos Tversky
would have something to say about that
In his house, Gary has a framed photo of himself lying prostrate in the ring that he refers to as “hubris protection”
Gary’s experiences with amateur boxing
There were a number of high-profile deaths in boxing in the early 80s
Duk-Koo Kim
was killed by
Ray Mancini
At Discover Gary worked with
Denise Grady
, who now works for the
New York Times
Denise did a
story
on what happens to the brain in boxing
She would slip articles under Gary’s door about boxing-related brain injuries
Gary would box with
Norman Mailer
’s nephew in a group Mailer had that boxed each other on Saturday mornings
Gary got the idea to box in the
Golden Gloves
and write an
article
about it
He was too old by a few months
Sports Illustrated
pulled it because he’d have to fake his birth certificate
Ended up writing it for
Playboy
instead
His SIL was angry that he wrote an article for a magazine that portrayed women in a bad way
Though he acknowledges that she had a point, he said that some of the best writers were writing for that magazine “and maybe later I’ll have the platform by which I can be too good for this approach”
He won his first fight against a police officer who “beat the crap out of me in the first round” when he realized he needed to punch back and knocked him out in the second round
In his second fight, he got knocked out in 1 minute and 37 seconds
Gary had only been boxing as an amateur for 4 months, but he had a
James Bond
complex
Getting knocked out was a reminder of his limits and that “there are things I should stay away from if I want to have a long and healthy life”
He never boxed again
