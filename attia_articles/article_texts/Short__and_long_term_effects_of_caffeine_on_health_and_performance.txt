Caffeine is woven so thoroughly throughout modern life that we rarely pause to consider its remarkable influence on human physiology and performance. From the morning coffee ritual to the pre-workout supplement, this molecule shapes our daily rhythms in ways both obvious and subtle. Yet despite its ubiquity — or perhaps because of it — many misconceptions persist about caffeine’s effects on health and performance.
In this comprehensive review, we’ll examine the scientific evidence behind caffeine’s impact on the body and mind.
