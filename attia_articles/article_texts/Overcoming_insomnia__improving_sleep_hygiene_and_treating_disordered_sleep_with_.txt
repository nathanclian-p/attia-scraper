Ashley Mason is a clinical psychologist and an associate professor at UCSF, where she leads the Sleep, Eating, and Affect (SEA) Laboratory. In this episode, Ashley provides a masterclass on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), detailing techniques like time in bed restriction, stimulus control, and cognitive restructuring to improve sleep. She explains how to manage racing thoughts and anxiety, optimize sleep environments, and use practical tools like sleep diaries to track progress. She also offers detailed guidance on sleep hygiene; explores the impact of temperature regulation, blue light exposure, and bedtime routines; and offers guidance on finding a CBT-I therapist, along with sharing practical steps you can take on your own before seeking professional help.

Defining insomnia: diagnosis, prevalence, and misconceptions [3:00]
Where did your interest in insomnia arise?
Ashley has been interested in sleep for a long time
She went to the University of Arizona for her doctoral work and studied with the late
Dick Bootzin
He’s one of the co-inventors of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)
Ashley found CBT-I particularly interesting because it works so well
We have so many different psychological treatments and they all have varying degrees of efficacy and effectiveness
The thing about CBT-I is that it’s kind of like a recipe: if you do it, it works
This was always just so interesting because it was so different than so many other psychotherapies out there that had so much more unpredictable outcomes
Ashley became much more interested in CBT-I after her postdoctoral work
When she was a post-doc at UCSF and started her assistant professorship, there was this gaping hole in treatment available for people with insomnia
She thought this might be a good way for her to get back into some clinical work (she was just doing research at the time)
“
I fell back in love with it because there’s almost nothing as rewarding as being able to see a patient seven times and that seventh time have them say something along the lines of, ‘I have my life back.’
”‒ Ashley Mason
Patients say something along the line of, “
I have my life back
.”
I’m going to get my drivers license back
I’m not afraid to drive with my kids in the car anymore
I’m going to go back to work
Ashley grew the clinic that she does CBT-I in
She loves it so much that she does it on top of her job
She meets with patients after hours, at night because it’s the most rewarding thing, and you can have such a big impact on people
And people need it
Help folks understand a little bit about insomnia and maybe go through some of the definitions around the different types of insomnia and maybe some of the different causes for it
And also what some of the other treatments for insomnia are
⇒
90% of adults at some point are going to struggle with insomnia, and at any given moment that might be between 5-10%
The interesting thing about insomnia is that it’s a very clinical diagnosis
There’s no blood test for insomnia
We can’t put you in a sleep lab overnight and do a test to see if you have insomnia
We don’t diagnose insomnia based on one night of bad sleep
If someone says, “
I didn’t sleep at all last night, or I haven’t slept even for just the last week,
” that’s not going to get a diagnosis of insomnia
There’s a whole suite of different “somnias” that we could talk about
The point that is the most salient [for defining insomnia] is just that when you have a problem sleeping and when it’s been going on for at least 3 months (a long time)
When you really feel it’s a problem, that’s when it’s time to get help
⇒
There’s plenty of people who don’t sleep a whole lot, but it’s not distressing to them, it’s not causing any problems in their life; they’re not going to meet a definition of insomnia per se
The folks who will tell you, “
I can’t sleep, haven’t been sleeping for months. It’s interfering with my life. It’s really upsetting.
”
And they’ve probably already started trying a whole bunch of things to try and help themselves to fix it (and this is where things get interesting)
Peter clarifies the point estimates [of prevalence] of insomnia
5-10% of the population would have insomnia at any point in time
Where it’s been going on for months, and it’s causing distress and impacting life
At the low end, that’s 1 in 20
At the high end, that’s 1 in 10 adults
That’s a higher estimate than Peter would have guessed, given her definition
⇒ Everything Ashley is talking about today is adults (she doesn’t do pediatrics)
Insomnia is for most people, probably quite episodic
It’s not necessarily a permanent state
People go in and out of it
The question is how quickly do people go out of it when they go in it?
And that’s what CBTI is so beautiful for ‒ it’s helping people get out of it quickly
There’s going to be things in your life that are going to just happen and they’re going to put you over the threshold for insomnia
How insomnia develops, and breaking the cycle with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) [7:45]
How insomnia begins and then how it’s perpetuated
These things are actually quite different
Everybody has a certain level of
predisposing factors
that are going to put us at risk for having sleeping problems, in particular, insomnia
Then we may experience what’s called a
precipitating factor
That could be a major life event like losing your job, getting a divorce, getting in a car accident
Some major unexpected unhappy life event that might throw you into a bout of insomnia
That event will end, and you will move on
But in the meantime, when you’re dealing with that event,
you develop behaviors to cope
with it
For example, pop a
Benadryl
to help you sleep or an
Ambien
(something stronger)
You might start taking naps the next day after a bad night of sleep to try and cope with it
You might start reading in bed a lot or flipping through your smartphone in bed
Doing all these different types of behaviors to try and help yourself calm down and actually get to sleep, which in the short term make a lot of sense
You’re trying to help yourself in the acute moment
But in the long term, these kinds of behaviors aren’t actually doing you any favors
And over time that precipitating factor is going to go away
But all of these behaviors that you’ve started doing to respond to the precipitating event, they’re what stick around; and those are what are going to perpetuate insomnia symptoms and problems
Can you say more about the predisposing factors? Are those genetic?
Genetic predisposing factors
1 – Patients will say they are a light sleeper
That’s tough to fix
Ashley will recommend something like earplugs and eye mask, a white noise machine
2 – If you are higher on the general psychological reactivity, you’re going to probably get pushed over the threshold more easily than someone else
Some people might get in a car accident, a fender bender, and they’re over it by the next day
Other people might feel more anxious as a result of that event
And that’s going to differ from person to person
You can argue that that’s genetic
You can argue that that’s based on early childhood or other experiences
Nature and nurture probably both contribute to that predisposition and there’s not a whole lot that we can do about that
The beauty of CBT-I
When people come in for treatment, they’re often pretty focused on what caused their insomnia
Ashley doesn’t ask people what caused their insomnia until the end of her first session with them
She’s asking them all these other kinds of questions about their behaviors now
And at the end she asks, “
Okay, so when did this start? What do you think might have caused this?
”
And get their attribution for what’s going on
Because at the end of the day, the intervention’s the same
That might differ a lot from the practice of medicine
She’s not an MD, she’s a PhD
In a lot of disease states, we often look at what caused what’s going on
She’s not really concerned
She’s more concerned about what you’re doing now that’s perpetuating the problem, and that’s where she intervenes
“
That’s why this particular treatment is so effective for so many different presentations of insomnia and causes of insomnia.
”‒ Ashley Mason
Whether people have difficulty falling asleep in the beginning of the night, waking up in the middle of the night, waking up too early in the morning
You might think these people all need wildly different treatment, but that’s not actually the case
Peter’s takeaway ‒
the focus is much more on the coping strategy and the behavior that came out of the predisposing factor or the precipitating event
