In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter revisits the topic of fasting, sharing how his thinking has evolved over time. The episode explores fasting-related terminology and common types of fasting, as well as the various reasons individuals might choose to fast. Peter explores potential benefits including improvements in body composition, metabolic health, lifespan extension, cardiovascular disease, cancer prevention and treatment, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, and autoimmune symptoms like arthritis. He also examines the risks and potential downsides of fasting and offers a practical framework to help assess when and how fasting may be most appropriately applied.

Why the topic of fasting is being revisited [1:45]
The topic of Fasting
:
First time fasting was covered in
AMA #11
, released January 2020.
This episode is AMA #72, highlighting how long it’s been since they fully addressed the topic.
Rationale for Revisit
Fasting is a highly requested and frequently misunderstood topic.
Though touched on in various episodes since AMA #11, this is the first full dedicated revisit.
Peter’s thinking has evolved since then, including patient application and personal practice.
Episode Structure Preview
Clarifying Terminology
Acknowledgment that confusion arises from inconsistent definitions (e.g., “fasting” means different things to different people).
First goal of the episode: define terms and types of fasting protocols.
Main Content Themes
Reasons people choose to fast and the purported or actual benefits.
Topic areas include:
Body composition
Metabolic health
Lifespan / longevity
Cardiovascular disease
Cancer (prevention and treatment)
Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s)
Autoimmune conditions (e.g., arthritis)
Risks and Downsides
Will explore potential negative effects of fasting and who should be cautious.
Practical Application
The episode will close with a framework to:
Help listeners decide how (or if) to use fasting.
Show how Peter uses fasting personally and with his patients.
The importance of being open to changing one’s opinion in science and medicine as new evidence emerges [4:15]
Why Changing Opinions Matters
Peter is known for changing his mind when new evidence emerges.
References the “Strong Convictions, Loosely Held” theme used in milestone episodes like
#200
and
#300
.
This episode focuses on fasting, a topic where Peter’s views have evolved over time based on new data and clinical experience.
Many public figures—and people in general—become overly attached to their initial beliefs and resist change.
When someone changes their mind publicly, people often criticize them by saying, “How could you say this if you used to say that?”
Peter’s Response: A Framework for Intellectual Flexibility
Everyone—not just scientists or doctors—should be open to changing opinions in light of new information.
In today’s world, especially in politics, changing your mind is often seen as a weakness. The more firmly someone sticks to their opinion, the more credible they appear.
Changing your mind should be seen as a strength, not a flaw.
Science is inherently probabilistic, not absolute. Even facts that feel like certainties (e.g., gravity) are grounded in probabilities.
Medicine and science evolve constantly. No belief should be held with rigid certainty.
Examples of Changing Positions
Peter received backlash for changing his position on GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic, Wegovy).

He quotes economist
John Maynard Keynes
: “
When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?
”
Guiding Principle
Peter is not wed to being right—he is wed to knowing what is right.
He recommends that others adopt the same orientation: focus on truth and growth, not ego or consistency.
Constant evolution of understanding is the best way to stay aligned with reality.
Defining fasting and how it fits in the framework of dietary restriction, time-restricted feeding, and calorie restriction [7:30]
Establishing a Foundational Nutrition Framework
Energy balance is essential: consuming too much or too little is harmful.
Adequate protein intake is a constant requirement for maintaining lean mass.
The ratio of carbohydrates to fats is less important as long as total energy intake is appropriate.
Sufficient micronutrient intake and avoiding toxins are also fundamental.
For over 80% of people (based on Peter’s clinical experience), maintaining energy balance requires effort and strategy.
Peter’s DR/TR/CR Framework
DR (Dietary Restriction): Deliberately restricts a specific dietary element.
Can involve limiting carbs, fats, animal products, or processed foods.
No single best method—many forms can work if the restriction is significant enough.
TR (Time restriction): Limits the eating window each day without necessarily changing food quality or quantity.
Also referred to as intermittent fasting.
Narrowing the eating window often naturally reduces caloric intake.
CR (Caloric Restriction): Focuses on reducing total calories consumed, regardless of the type or timing of food.
May not involve food type or timing changes—just smaller portions.
These strategies can be combined.
Example: During peak cycling performance, Peter used both DR and TR, eating one snack and one meal daily, with significant dietary constraints, resulting in being 16–17 pounds lighter than his current weight.
Clarifying the Term “Fasting”
“Fasting” lacks a standardized definition and is used broadly.
It can describe:
Complete water-only fasting for multiple days.
Daily time-restricted feeding (e.g., 16:8 or 18:6 fasting windows).
The discussion in the episode will further explore various fasting protocols, their definitions, and their pros and cons.
