The five main tools for managing blood glucose numbers [33:45]
Five tools that you can use to manipulate glucose:
Nutrition
Exercise
Management of stress (mostly, but not all, about cortisol)
Sleep
Medications/supplements
Start with the most powerful leavers
—
nutrition, sleep, and exercise
Everyone’s going to be starting from a different place
You can use the CGM to push the boundaries a little bit to tell you what is your carbohydrate tolerance
A given person can have two totally different carbohydrate tolerances depending on their activity levels
Peter uses a personal example,
When I was cycling a lot, which is the last thing that I did quasi seriously, I was easily consuming 600 grams of carbohydrates a day and no issues maintaining normal glucose homeostasis
that’s 2,400 calories of carbs a day
If I were to consume 2,400 calories of carbohydrates a day, I don’t suspect my glucose would look nearly as good as it did then. And that’s because I used to be exercising nearly 28 hours a week and now I’m exercising maybe 10 hours a week
Again, you’re just going to basically tweak these interventions based on your starting point and your aspiration
Sleep
Sleep cannot be overlooked
The data for poor sleep and insulin resistance are actually quite strong (see
Matthew Walker episode
)
Even short-term bouts of sleep deprivation, like two weeks of four hours of sleep per night result in about a
50% reduction in glucose disposal
which would result in hyperglycemia
Sleep deprivation is particularly insidious because it affects other things downstream like you motivation to exercise, your willpower to not eat crappy food, stress/anxiety levels, etc.
