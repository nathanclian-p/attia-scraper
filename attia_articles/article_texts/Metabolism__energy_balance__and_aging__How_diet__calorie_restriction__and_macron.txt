Eric’s background and current work metabolism and measuring energy expenditure [3:00]
Eric and Peter worked together at NuSI
Peter was part of an organization called
NuSI
, and Eric was 1 of 6 of the principal investigators for a very audacious experiment and part of something called the Energy Balance Consortium, along with
Kevin Hall
,
Steve Smith
,
Rudy Leibel
,
Mike Rosenbaum
, and
Marc Reitman
It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to do something that had never been done before, which was a multi-center indirect calorimetry inpatient study that was really aimed at trying to at least pilot what would be necessary to do the definitive experiment to answer a question which has to do with the nature of calories and weight gain
For 4 years, they had the pleasure of working together and really getting into the weeds of how one technically tries to measure these things and how difficult it is and all of the challenges and potential pitfalls of this
Give folks a sense of your life’s work and your life’s passion
Eric has been at
Pennington Biomedical Research
for 24 years
He was the Associate Executive Director for Clinical Science
He joined Pennington after spending 2.5 years at Eli Lilly
Before that, he was 15 years at the NIH (intramural research)
“
The reason I came to this country was to build the first metabolic chamber or indirect calorimetry chamber to measure energy expenditure in people over periods of hours and days.
”‒ Eric Ravussin
Tell folks a little bit about what it means to be intramural versus extramural NIH
The NIH budget is about $33-35 billion, but there is a group which is intramural
Most of the money (80-85%) goes to all the academic institutions doing biomedical research in the country (extramural research)
In intramural research you are an employee of the NIH, you work at the NIH campus, and your funding comes from the organization that you work for
Eric was intramural based in Phoenix Arizona
He worked a lot with the Pima Indians ‒ they have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the second-highest prevalence of obesity in the world
What Eric likes about intramural research is that you are judged after the fact
You have a budget and you can do whatever you want, and every 3 years you are judged
Whereas extramural, we chase these grants and you have to basically provide preliminary data, hypothesis, and you are judged before doing the study
Eric thinks you can be much more creative being intramural than extramural
Pennington is a pretty unique institution
It’s becoming the largest institution for research in nutrition and obesity
We concentrate mostly on nutrition and obesity
We have about 500 people working at Pennington and everybody is doing research
We have no formal teaching (yes, we have postdocs and things like that)
We do research and we have maybe a functional budget of $80 million per year
50% or 45% of that is NIH extramural money coming to Pennington
We do some sponsored project for pharma or biotech
We have grants from associations like the American Diabetes Association or American Heart Association and so on
We do basic science, clinical science, and population science
Basically, which is to reach the community and implement some of the discovery into the community
The science behind metabolic chambers for measuring energy expenditure, and the complexities of indirect and direct calorimetry [8:00]
There’s 2 things:
indirect calorimetry
and
direct calorimetry
You generate your energy metabolism or ATP by oxidative process, and you oxidize carbohydrate, fat, and a little protein
The build up these ATPs which are used for generation or maintenance of the cells or activity and so on
Now, when you have this metabolism, you produce heat
If you have no exercise, no external work, all the energy which is provided in generating this ATP is lost as heat
And this is direct calorimetry
Eric was fortunate when he did his Ph.D. back in Lausanne, Switzerland to have access to both indirect and direct calorimetry
You can really do fantastic studies
We did a study of measuring
in vivo
what we call the P/O ratio
How many oxygen do you need to generate 1 ATP and all these kinds of things, by the combination of these 2 techniques
When you’re doing
direct calorimetry
on something like food, if you want to know the energy content of food, you can burn the food and measure the heat
It is also possible to do direct calorimetry in humans, and Eric was fortunate to be at a place which had 1 of the 2 direct calorimeters
At the time, there was one in Bethesda (it doesn’t exist anymore, nor does the one in Switzerland)
A
direct calorimeter
a little bit bigger than a cubic meter box, and you recover all the heat and you have dry heat by convection and you have a gradient layer capturing the heat production
You collect the evaporative heat losses from perspiration, expiration and so on, and you merge all that and you have a complete heat balance of the person
With direct calorimetry, we measure these 2 kinds of heat, and this is basically equal to your metabolic rate
You generate energy by oxidation of substrate and the byproduct is heat
And without exercise or external work, energy in is equal energy out
Eric did a lot of these studies during his Ph.D.
Now going to
indirect calorimetry
, this is an easier one than direct
A metabolic chamber is like a hotel room in which you can live 1-2 days
Peter stayed in one of these rooms at Pennington in Baton Rouge
Here we measure oxygen consumption and CO
2
production
Oxygen is used to oxidize the substrate; it produces CO
2
and water
Knowing oxygen consumption and CO
2
production, you can calculate the energy expenditure or the energy generated by this oxidative process; and you can also calculate the substrate that you oxidize
If the ratio between the VCO
2,
the CO
2
production and the oxygen consumption is 1, you oxidize carbohydrate
If the ratio is 0.7, you oxidize fat
And protein is something in between (0.82) depending on the protein
Peter summarizes
:
By measuring just these 2 things: the concentration of oxygen consumed and the rate at which it’s being consumed, and the same with the production of CO
2
You can infer the
total energy consumption
(total calories consumed, kcal)
And by looking at the ratio of VCO
2
and VO
2
,  you can calculate what fraction of that is coming from
oxidizing carbohydrate versus fat
Peter explains, “
Having spent probably a total of eight days of my life inside metabolic chambers across a period of a couple of years, it never ceases to amaze me, never just how accurately these rooms work
.”
Peter uses an indirect calorimeter all the time
measuring VO
2
max
It’s basically the same technology, but it’s easier because you’re strapping the mask to your face, so you have perfect access to exactly the O
2
consumption and the CO
2
production
It’s doing the exact same calculation
It’s going to tell you exactly how much energy you’re utilizing and where the substrate comes from
In that situation, you’re interested in knowing the maximum amount of VO
2
or O
2
consumption
What would you estimate is the error on the hotel room sized indirect calorimeter where you don’t have the luxury of just slapping a mask to the person’s face for a few days?
When Eric was at the NIH, they did a lot of reliability testing in the same person
You can also calibrate the system with standard gas that you know the exact concentration
You can also mimic someone by burning alcohol or propane and you can vary the rate of burning
When Eric did a study with 4 different chambers, they validated the chambers, ones against the other one, and we accepted to have 3% deviation for CO
2
or oxygen
Based on stoichiometry, you know exactly how much alcohol or propane you burn, you know how much CO
2
should be produced, and how much oxygen has been consumed
And this is what we did
The indirect calorimeter is very, very precise and you don’t have the inconvenience of the mask
You couldn’t measure with a mask for 24 hours or 2 days
When Peter as in that chamber for a couple of days (on separate occasions), we were trying to replicate his life as much as possible
He had 3 meals prepared
He had an exercise bike, weights, and equipment
We were very interested in seeing how that would compare with what we knew Peter was experiencing in the outside world based on when we could put a mask on him.
We also spent about 10 days using
doubly labeled water
(which we’ll talk about at some point)
All of that is to say that scientists such as yourself have some pretty high fidelity tools to measure energy expenditure; but it comes with a caveat, which is it has to be done under this very controlled setting
These people need to be in a metabolic ward inside a chamber
Which  is basically a NASA grade gas chamber with O
2
and CO
2
sensors
Peter asks, “
How many sensors… would be in a particular chamber?
”
We don’t need many because we need to homogenize the air in the room
We have to measure humidity
We have to measure temperature because you have to do this correction, what we call STPD, which is standard pressure, et cetera, to calculate the energy generated by this oxygen
It’s quite phenomenal the accuracy of those ‒ the accuracy or the precision is about 2.5%
Now if you repeat yourself 5x and myself, there’s a little bit more variability because we vary from one day to another one and so on
But this is quite amazing that we can calculate so precisely your energy expenditure during a day or two days and so on
The accuracy of calories consumed
