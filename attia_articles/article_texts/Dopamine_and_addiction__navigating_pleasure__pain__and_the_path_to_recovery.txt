Anna Lembke is the Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic and author of
Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence
. In this episode, Anna dives deep into the biochemistry and neurobiology of addiction, exploring the critical role of dopamine and the prefrontal cortex. She shares her framework for diagnosing and treating addiction, providing real-world examples involving alcohol, gambling, cannabis, social media, and more. Anna outlines the risk factors for addiction, including inherited and nurture-based risks, explores the rise of addictions in younger generations, and discusses effective ways to address these issues with children. Additionally, she touches on healthy coping strategies, the evolution of the “marshmallow experiment,” and provides insights into GLP-1 agonists as a possible tool for addiction treatment. Finally, she reflects on the value of 12-step programs and how she navigates the emotional challenges of her work.

The role of dopamine and the prefrontal cortex in addiction [3:00]
Understanding some of the biochemistry and neurobiology of dopamine
Dopamine
is a neurotransmitter, so it’s a chemical that we make in our brains
Neurotransmitters
are the chemicals that allow for fine-tuned modulation of the neural circuits that make us who we are
You might think of the brain as a collection of wires
Those wires are neurons
They send electrical impulses, one to the other, but the neurons don’t actually touch end to end
There’s a little gap between them called the
synapse
, and that gap is bridged by molecules called neurotransmitters

There are many different neurotransmitters in the brain, and they have many different functions
Dopamine has become the common currency for measuring pleasure, reward, and motivation
It’s not the only neurotransmitter involved in that process, but it is the final common pathway for all reinforcing substances and behaviors
Whether the substance is primarily modulating our serotonergic system or norepinephrine or the nicotinic system or the endogenous opioid system or the endogenous cannabinoid system, the final common pathway for all of those chemical cascades is to release dopamine in a dedicated part of the brain called the
reward circuitry
Reward circuitry consists of the
prefrontal cortex
(that large gray matter area right behind our foreheads) and these deeper limbic or emotion brain structures like the
nucleus accumbens
and the
ventral tegmental area

We’re always releasing dopamine at a baseline tonic level
But when we do something that’s pleasurable or reinforcing , then temporarily we will increase dopamine firing above baseline
Something that our brains consider salient or important for survival, in some cases it might even be an aversive stimulus
That generally feels good to us, which is how we tell our brains, “
Oh, this is important. I should approach, explore, and consider doing this again.
”
Broadly speaking, that’s dopamine’s function
It’s not its only function
Dopamine is also really important for movement
Parkinson’s disease
(which is a movement disorder) is characterized by a decrease or a depletion of dopamine in a different part of the brain called the
substantia nigra
One of the ways that we treat Parkinson’s is to actually give people L-DOPA, which is a dopamine precursor
Why do we give them L-DOPA and not dopamine?
Because dopamine itself actually can’t cross the blood-brain barrier
So we give them a precursor that crosses the blood-brain barrier and then binds to dopamine receptors in the substantial nigra allowing for more fluid movements in people with Parkinson’s
Unfortunately, L-DOPA transformed to dopamine also binds dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, which is why about a quarter of folks with Parkinson’s who get treated with L-DOPA end up with addictive disorders that are usually reversible when you stop the L-DOPA and tend to be dose dependent
So the more L-DOPA, the more likely the sex addiction, shopping addiction or whatever the compulsive behavior
Are humans more susceptible to addiction because we have a larger prefrontal cortex, or is it not as simple as the anatomic size of this part of the brain?
The prefrontal cortex comes up a lot when we talk about dementia and higher order cognitive function judgment centers
It is also something that is more developed in our species than others
The prefrontal cortex has many roles, and when we think about its role in addiction or other appetitive disorders, it actually has a stop function
If you analogize to a car, the prefrontal cortex acts like the brakes on the car
It allows for delayed gratification
This is where we have the control centers
It allows for appreciating future consequences
It lights up when we’re engaged in autobiographical narrative
And of course, narrative is part of the ways that we actually create metacognitive awareness to inform future decisions
Having a very robust prefrontal cortex is potentially protective against addiction
People who have cognitive or attentional disorders, who are thought to have a
disorder of the prefrontal cortex
(for example,
attention deficit disorder
) are at higher risk to develop addictive disorders
The nucleus accumbens is the accelerator
The nucleus accumbens is deep in the brain, is rich in dopamine releasing neurons, and that acts like the accelerator on the car
“
Addiction is a problem either with too little on the brakes, too much on the accelerator, or some combination thereof.
”‒ Anna Lembke
Anna explains, “
In terms of whether or not humans are more likely to get addicted than animals, I would say no
.”
What’s remarkable about this reward circuitry is how incredibly conserved it is over millions of years of evolution and across species
Neuroscientists used to talk about the lizard brain or the triune brain
They’re not typically using that phraseology so much anymore, but what they were getting at was that if you look at the
nucleus accumbens
,
ventral tegmental area
, it’s amazingly unchanged across species over millions of years of evolution
It’s really our reflexive approach in pleasure and avoiding pain is what has kept us alive for so many, many generations on the planet
It’s a very basic primordial structure that all living organisms, even primitive organisms have
Even the most primitive nematode or worm will release dopamine in response to food in its environment, which that dopamine allows it to locomote toward food
It’s probably not that the same neurotransmitter involved in movement is also involved in pleasure, reward, and motivation, because prior to about 500 years ago, if you wanted to get a reward, you had to work for it
That’s no longer true, which is one of the reasons our brains are so confused today
You could almost make the argument that because we have these large frontal lobes that can sort of reason and appreciate future consequences, human beings might be even more capable of getting out of the cycle of addiction than other organisms
It is miraculous that even people deep in the most severe addiction can find somewhere within themselves the capacity to stop using
“
It seems to me almost a miracle in my clinical work when I get people who have been in severe addictions for decades who somehow find it within themselves, either through some logical reasoning or some spiritual surrender or some combination to actually get into recovery.

, which was highlighted in the New York Times as one of the top five books to read to understand the opioid epidemic. Her most recent book and New York Times bestseller is,
Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence
. It combines the neuroscience of addiction with the wisdom of recovery to explore the problem of compulsive overconsumption in a dopamine-overloaded world. [
