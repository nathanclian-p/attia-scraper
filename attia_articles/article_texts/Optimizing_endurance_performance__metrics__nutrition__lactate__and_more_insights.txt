Olav Aleksander Bu is an internationally renowned sports scientist acclaimed for his coaching prowess with elite athletes spanning a diverse range of sports disciplines. In this episode, Olav returns to dive deeper into his groundbreaking work as an endurance coach, exercise scientist, engineer, and physiologist. The discussion explores his data-driven approach to coaching, unpacking key performance metrics like functional threshold power, VO2 max, and lactate threshold, while emphasizing the importance of consistent testing protocols. Olav shares insights on how training methodologies differ across sports, the impact of nutrition on endurance performance, and the evolving strategies for carbohydrate metabolism in fueling athletes for races. Olav concludes with a discussion on the use of artificial intelligence for optimizing training insights and performance.

Olav’s unique, engineering-driven approach to endurance coaching [2:45]
Last time we spoke really about the most nuanced ins-and-outs of cardiorespiratory fitness [
episode #294
]
For the person who didn’t catch that episode, can you give the one-minute version of what you do and why you’re certainly one of the few people that would be poised to talk about what we’re going to talk about today?
Olav’s background is in engineering, and that principle has guided him through his journey in endurance sports (or sports in general)
He embarked on a journey 15 years ago of extreme in-depth longitudinal studies on 2 of the arguably fittest athletes in the whole world [
Kristian Blummenfelt
and
Gustav Iden
]
A large part of that involves technology development simply because he is working at the edge of available information
In some cases they have to develop technology to allow them to gain a more granular understanding of why things are the way they are
In many ways, he’s an applied scientist
Is your laboratory both a
CPET lab
and a racing environment where you work with triathletes?
Yes and no
Olav works with a mixture of athletes, between triathletes, cyclists, runners, track and field, to even sailors (which is on the explosive end of the domain and not endurance)
Definitions and applications of key performance metrics: FTP, power, anaerobic threshold, and lactate threshold [4:45]
We’re going to use a lot of terms today (anaerobic threshold, lactate threshold, VO
2
max, FTP). Can you define FTP (functional threshold power)?
There are a couple definitions, the original definition of FTP (by
Andy Coggan
) was to do a 5-minutes all-out effort, have a short pause, then do a 20-minute all-out effort, and then subtract 5% from that to find your FTP
Typically that would be your 20-minutes all-out effort minus 5%
The reason for that is to try to get a ballpark idea of your sustainable power output over an hour
Over the years we have learned  that this is not accurate and there have become different ways of doing it
Some people do a warmup, then do 20-minutes all-out and subtract 5% (that’s different)
Peter used to do a gentle warmup for a hour, do 20 minutes, and then subtract 10%
Peter wants people to understand the spirit of FTP and not get mired in the details
FTP approximates an energy zone that is more than just an all-out, but clearly less than what you could hold indefinitely ‒ it’s directionally about the highest output you could have for an hour
There are different ways to approximate it
Olav adds that
it’s more important to determine this consistently
using the same protocol for comparisons
How does FTP differ from another term that is used interchangeably (erroneously), which is critical power?
Critical power is determined from doing multiple all-out efforts
You apply a reverse extrapolation to figure out the critical power
“
I like the critical power approach a little bit better
.”‒ Olav Aleksander Bu
What is that trying to approximate?
Critical power is where you try to divide something into 2 zones (that’s an oversimplification)
To distinguish between non-severe and a severe state
In the same way as FTP is trying to figure out what power you are capable of staying at for a prolonged period
Where you get into a territory where small changes have a huge consequence on the duration that you’re capable of holding it
Where does critical power typically lie in relation to FTP?
This depends a little on how you test FTP
How FTP has been used recently had deviated from how the authors originally devised it
Normally, FTP would be slightly lower in power output than critical power
But this depends on how critical power is defined
From a metabolic perspective, critical power sits somewhere between your maximum lactate steady state (anaerobic threshold) and
VO
2
max
Typically, it’s more close to VO
2
steady state (we’ll define that soon)
Many of these metrics (FTP, critical power) are easiest to think about in terms of cycling because we use power meters. Do the same concepts still apply in swimming and running?
Yes
For simplicity, it helps to use 1 condensed number such as
critical pace
Testing this in running and swimming is not too different from what you would do in cycling
However, you have access to more granular information that you lose when you call it FTP or critical power
If you present only that number, you have taken 2-dimensional information and made it 1-dimensional (meaning that you only look at the Y-axis and you take away the how long you are able to sustain something)
When you first do
critical power testing
, it’s more interesting to know how how far you are able to get over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 50 minutes
And then see what happens the next time you do it for 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 50 minutes
It’s quite crucial to understand what’s happening with the different balances in the body
Most people think of
FTP
as a 20-minute power, so it’s even simpler (more condensed) information
2 things can normally happen with training
1 – You increase your general capacity (power and/or capacity are increased)
2 – At some point we are all time limited, and this is where we need to prioritize what’s more important for us: explosive speed or endurance
This becomes interesting for how you guide training, understanding what’s happening between different power or pace and durations
How do we define anaerobic threshold (AT)?
