Jason’s upbringing and what inspired him to join the military [3:15]
People who listen to this podcast have heard Peter talk about rucking a lot over the past year or two
Peter points back a lot to Jason and
Michael Easter
[Michael was a guest in episodes
#225
and

We are going to talk a lot about rucking today, and Peter think’s it’s important for people to understand what it is and how-tos
To put Jason’s mission in context, it makes sense to understand his journey
Where Jason grew up and his background in the military
Jason was born in Ohio
His mom was really young when she had him (age 18)
They moved to Gainesville, Florida, and Jason was the unofficial mascot for the women’s tennis team (go Gators)
He bounced around with his mom and was very close to her
The military was not really a thing for him early on
His grandfather fought in Korea as an artillery officer, but he never talked about it
His uncle was a helicopter pilot, but Jason didn’t see him that much
Was your dad in the picture?
He was and still very much is
He’s still in Ohio along with both sets of grandparents
His parents were in high school together
Ohio was always a grounding thing for him, and his grandparents had an extraordinary amount of influence on his life
In college, what did you want to do?
To give the timeline, Jason went to Bolles School in Jacksonville, FL
It’s a very competitive athletic school
High school was the hardest thing he’s ever done
The English department kicked his butt
He had 8 classes and would rather go back to the Special Forces Qualification Course than do a year of English at Bolles
Jason played tennis and a little basketball
Growing up, he was always into sports and being really active
He didn’t know what he was going to do with his life
He wasn’t good enough to play tennis at a big school
He played D3 tennis at Emory in Atlanta
That was a great way for him to focus
At Emory, he studied economics and art history
Both of his grandmothers were docents at the Dayton Art Institute in Ohio
Being in art museums was an important part of how he grew up
He did well in college and graduated in May of 2001
He was very focused in college
After college, he remembers applying to places that people told him he should: your bank, your consulting firm
At age 22, he didn’t know what any of that was
What do you do at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey if you’re 22?
Importantly, you pay your dues
Jaysons explains, “
You have to figure out how to get into these larger organizations, and I didn’t know how to do that yet.
”
So he went and traveled around Central America and backpacked a little bit, then came back and got a job working at a call center of a marketing firm in Dayton Beach on 9/11
Literally across the street from the racetrack
That was the day that anybody that was alive remembers exactly where they were on 9/11
For Jason, it was just this enormous sense of sadness and anger that led to rage, and as a 22 years old, military aged male, with no dependants, no attachments, he felt compelled to serve our country
Saying you want to serve, watching the night vision goggles (NVGs) and everything is in green on CNN is a lot different that actually signing up to go fight in a time of war
Jason looked at all kinds of places: the CIA, the FBI, the whole alphabet soup universe
Those places take a long time to get into, and rightfully so
Even though he had just gone to college
The application process is long
It was a time when everybody wanted to serve our country and you couldn’t just walk up, pick your branch, and become an officer
There was a line a mile long of young people that wanted to serve our country because of what happened at 9/11
Now it’s 2003 and he had started working at a bank in DC and is still applying to places
It keeps not clicking
What happened in that year and a half between 9/11 and early 2003?
He felt really down where he was in Daytona Beach and Jacksonville Beach, he felt really far away from what was going on
He went and visited some friends in New York and being at Ground Zero just felt very communal in a positive way
It felt like that’s where the decisions were being made
It felt like that was just such an important place at that time, and he wanted to see it
He went to New York in October of 2001, and you could smell it anywhere you were
God bless the people that worked through that
Day after day, they just pulled bodies out of the rubble
Jason still gets goosebumps when he thinks about the amount of sacrifice and the service that went into that day and then to the handoff to the military
The military is kind of a family business, and you’re best served, if you’re familiar with what that looks like
Jason’s path to becoming a Green Beret, his calling to serve, and staying true to oneself [10:30]
Peter points out that in late ‘01 and most of ‘02 presumably anybody could walk into a recruiting office and join the Marines or join the Army or things like that (not necessarily special forces)
Was that something you were thinking of or were you still thinking you wanted to be in the CIA or something?
