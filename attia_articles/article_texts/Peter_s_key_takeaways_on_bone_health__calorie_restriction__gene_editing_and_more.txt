In this quarterly podcast summary (QPS) episode, Peter summarizes his biggest takeaways from the last three months of guest interviews on the podcast. Peter shares key insights from his discussions on diverse topics such as dopamine and addiction with Anna Lembke, the current state and exciting future of CRISPR-mediated gene editing with Feng Zhang, how to build and maintain strong bones from youth to old age with Belinda Beck, how calorie restriction may influence longevity and metabolic health with Eric Ravussin, and the role of testosterone and TRT in prostate cancer with Ted Schaeffer. Additionally, Peter shares any personal behavioral adjustments or modifications to his patient care practices that have arisen from these engaging discussions.

Overview of topics to be covered [1:45]
Our quarterly podcast summaries are still relatively new, and what we’re doing is going over Peter’s notes from previous episodes
We won’t necessarily summarize these episodes as much as talk about Peter’s biggest takeaways
We’ll also have a conversation on how that’s affected either his behavior or how he deals with patients
Today we’re going to talk about
Dopamine through Anna’s podcast
CRISPR, which is super interesting through Feng’s podcast
Bone mineral density and lifting in females with Belinda
Calorie restriction with Eric
Prostate cancer with Ted (a shorter episode)
This is not a substitute for going back and listening to the podcast
Peter is not attempting to provide the full context of everything
What he’s trying to do is capture what he’s taking away in real time as he’s having these discussions
He shares what he’s making notes on and what he’s pulling out as the most interesting stuff
Sometimes that comes with an assumption that other content is heard and understood
The hope is that you’re listening to this after you’ve heard these podcasts, or that you listen  to this and maybe go back and listen to a podcast that you skipped because the insight is particularly interesting
Anna Lembke episode: addiction, dopamine’s role in pleasure and pain, and managing addictive behaviors [4:15]
#321 – Dopamine and addiction: navigating pleasure, pain, and the path to recovery | Anna Lembke, M.D.
(October 14, 2024)
***
Start with your main takeaways from that episode
Peter read Anna’s book [
Dopamine Nation
] before interviewing her and enjoyed it a lot
He was looking forward to talking about this and had a lot of questions about what really constitutes addiction
The book is really about addiction more than it is about dopamine
Dopamine
is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the reward system (and therefore in the addiction system), but it’s not the only one
Peter’s interest was less about the nuts and bolts of dopamine and more around the science of addiction
We started with defining the traditional aspects of what defines addiction
Out of control compulsive use
The cravings
The continued use despite consequences
Tolerance to the stimulus
Ultimately withdrawal when the stimulus is removed
You can view that through the traditional lens of how people think of an addiction like alcohol ‒ all of those things check-off
And there are behavioral addictions that show up as well
Everything from gambling to sex to workaholism
What are the factors that influence an addiction?
Peter wanted to understand how heritable addiction is
Meaning how much is this written into the genetic code?
It turned out quite a bit according to the heritability data
This came up in the
podcast with Karl Deisseroth
where we talked about eating disorders, depression, schizophrenia
The typical way that these
twin studies
are done is they look at the prevalence of a certain condition in identical twins that were raised apart
That’s really the best tool we have to
understand how much of a role do genes play?
You take 2 people with identical genes raised in a completely different environment,
“
Based on that, Anna said that addiction is about 50 to 60% heritable… it’s a big enough amount that it can’t be ignored, but it’s not so big an amount that the die is cast.
”‒ Peter Attia
Meaning just because you come from a line of people who have an addiction to one thing or another doesn’t mean that your fate is sealed
Other things that play a role in addiction
She described them as nature, nurture, and neighborhood
1 – Nature is your genes
2 – Nurture is how you’re raised
3 – Neighborhood is the environment you’re in
If heritability is 50-61%, 40-50% comes from how you were raised (obvious things and subtle things)
Are you raised around people that are engaging in a certain behavior?
Do you have experiences in life, for example, trauma that might predispose you to certain addictive behaviors?
This idea of
neighborhood
is very important and has a lot to do with anybody who’s ever considered trying to break a bad habit
If you struggle with gambling, it’s really hard to break a gambling habit if all your friends are gamblers
You either have to get a bunch of new friends or somehow just decide you’re going to hang out with a bunch of people who gamble but not do it yourself
Very difficult
Why do some people have a certain lock and key configuration for certain addictions?
This is another topic that Peter found incredibly fascinating, and we don’t know the answer
Peter used himself as an example: he really enjoys alcohol
He enjoys the taste but doesn’t think he could be an alcoholic if he tried
If you surrounded him with alcoholics, it would never appeal to him to drink in the morning or drink in a manner that would lead to excessive use
It’s not clear why that is
It’s not moral superiority
There’s something in his brain that doesn’t get enough of that cycle from alcohol; it doesn’t work that way for him
The same is true with gambling
Peter was in Vegas giving a talk a  little while ago and had to walk through a casino 25 times to and from where he was going
Not to be disparaging of people who are in casinos at 7 in the morning…
If someone offered Peter a job to sit in the casino and play blackjack and they’ll pay him a million dollars a month to do this and cover all his losses and he can keep all the winnings
He couldn’t do it
He couldn’t imaging something less appealing
Yet there are people who ruin their lives doing this, why?
Similarly, there are things Peter is addicted to that most people would look at and say, “
Who could do that?
”
“
This ‘why’ question I don’t think we have an answer to yet. And yet it totally fascinates me. To me, that’s the most interesting question in this space.
”‒ Peter Attia
How Anna works with clients
She’s a psychiatrist, and one of the first steps that she does is a
4-week dopamine fast
Which means a 4-week total abstinence from the behavior that one is trying to rid themselves of
Peter thinks this 4-week dopamine fast is valuable for any of us that are trying to cope with our own addictions
She said that 80% of her patients will feel better after the 4-week fast
Now she also noted some of those people need medications to help them through that
For example, if a person is trying to do a dopamine fast around alcohol, they may actually require
benzodiazepines
medically to help with that transition
Of course, that’s not always the case
We also discussed a woman that was basically smoking pot 24/7 and was doing it because of her anxiety
It turned out the anxiety was coming from smoking all that pot, but this wasn’t realized until she was able to abstain from it
