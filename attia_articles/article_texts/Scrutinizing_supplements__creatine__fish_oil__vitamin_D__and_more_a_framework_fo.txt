In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter explores the complex world of supplements by introducing a practical framework for evaluating their effectiveness and relevance to individual health needs. Rather than providing a simple list of recommendations, Peter aims to equip listeners with the tools to critically assess supplements on their own. He then applies this framework to discuss research on several popular supplements, including creatine, fish oil, vitamin D, B vitamins, and ashwagandha. Additionally, he covers key factors in assessing supplement quality, helping listeners develop a deeper understanding of how to make informed decisions based on their personal health goals.

Overview of episode topics [1:45]
Main topic
: Supplements
The challenge with the topic of supplements is that it’s so variable person to person – a variety of supplements and doses
Today, Peter has instead decided to explain a framework for how one should think about supplements
Additionally, Peter will go through case studies of a variety of supplements to talk through it and allow listeners to then be able to apply it in their own life
Peter will go through case studies for:
Creatine
fish oil
vitamin D
B vitamins
ashwagandha
How Peter evaluates patients’ supplement regimens, and common misconceptions about supplements vs. pharmaceuticals [3:00]
Assessing Patients’ Supplement Use
When patients enter the practice, their full medical history is gathered, including:
Prescription medications
Over-the-counter supplements
Hormones
Any other exogenous molecules they consume
There is a wide range in supplement usage among patients:
Some take absolutely nothing—no prescription medications or supplements.
Others take no medications but have a supplement list that is two pages long.
Most patients fall somewhere in between.
The mental model for evaluation:
Supplements are analyzed using a process similar to how the kidney filters glucose, sodium, and potassium:
Everything is “dumped out” first, and then the question is asked: What should be added back in?
This doesn’t mean literally stopping everything, but it serves as a thought process for analysis.
Patients Often Don’t Know Why They Take Certain Supplements
Many patients don’t have a clear reason for why they are taking certain supplements.
Common responses when asked why they take a supplement:
“I saw someone on Instagram talking about it.”
“A doctor recommended it years ago, but I don’t remember why.”
This lack of clarity reinforces the need for a structured evaluation framework.
The Misconception About “Natural” Supplements vs. Pharmaceuticals
Some patients strongly prefer supplements over medications and express views such as:
“I don’t believe in taking medicine—only natural supplements.”
Peter’s response: There is a difference between supplements and pharmaceuticals, but patients should truly understand that difference instead of making assumptions.
The key distinction is regulation, not necessarily effectiveness or safety.
Regulatory Differences Between Supplements & Pharmaceuticals
Supplements:
Not regulated by the FDA in the same way as pharmaceuticals.
Are generally classified as “GRAS” (Generally Regarded as Safe) by the FDA.
The process for determining safety is not rigorous and lacks formal oversight.
Pharmaceuticals:
While not perfect, they undergo a more stringent approval process.
Must clear regulatory hurdles before being prescribed.
Overlapping Ingredients Between Supplements & Pharmaceuticals
Some supplements contain active ingredients found in prescription drugs.
Example: Red rice yeast vs. Statins
Some patients refuse to take a statin (e.g., pravastatin) to lower ApoB.
However, they are comfortable taking red rice yeast, not realizing that:
High doses of red rice yeast function similarly to a modest dose of pravastatin.
Key lesson: The natural vs. pharmaceutical distinction is often misleading, and all molecules should be evaluated through the same lens.
Purpose of the Framework Discussion
The goal is to analyze supplements objectively rather than emotionally or ideologically.
Today’s discussion focuses on over-the-counter supplements because:
It’s the most common area of patient confusion.
It is harder to evaluate compared to pharmaceuticals due to lack of regulation.
The framework being introduced will help patients critically assess any supplement they take.
