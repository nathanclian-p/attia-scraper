Matthew’s TED Talk, and his favorite public speakers [3:40]
Matthew recently gave a TED Talk:
Sleep is your superpower
Matthew’s favorite speakers:
Carl Sagan
Richard Feynman
Ken Robinson
⇒ TED Talk:
How to escape education’s death valley
“They transcend being an exquisite public speaker into being someone who is just so compelling because they add to this sprinkle layer on top called wonderment.”
How good are the current sleep trackers like Oura, Fitbit, etc.? [6:45]
What can the common sleep trackers tell us about sleep?
Best at
: Estimating total duration of sleep (Two-class model)
Pretty good at
: Determining where you’re in awake, non-REM, and REM (Three-class model)
Least accurate when
: Estimating your time split between 4 stages… awake, light non-REM, deep non-REM, and REM (Four-class model)
⇒ Matthew says don’t fret: “I wouldn’t get too nervous about some of your sort of deep sleep versus light sleep numbers. Some of them could be accurate within an individual, but for others it can be more tricky because of their physiology that’s not giving the right signals for class accuracy.”
Trend lines
and
relative changes
are more important
Once you establish some kind of baseline and you see a deviation from that baseline, it’s more than likely that that deviation is a real deviation rather than a problem of the technology because the technology, even though it’s errorful is consistently errorful night after night after night
So any variance from your baseline is where you want to focus more of your attention
Trendlines: Matthew advises to pay most attention to your
weekly trend line
s when using a sleep tracker
The Oura ring
Peter uses (and is an investor and advisor) the
Oura ring
He says that the Oura ring is also very good at measuring and tracking:
Resting heart rate
while sleeping
Heart rate variability
Body temperature
Movement
⇒ More regarding heart rate
Peter: “When your resting heart rate is up seven beats per minute and your heart rate variability is down 20%… those are bad things.”
What can cause these heart rate issues?
For Peter at least… it is typically:
The room was boiling hot
Ate a monster meal 10 minutes before bed
He had two alcoholic drinks or more
Jet lag
Is it bad to eat food too close to bedtime? [11:40]
