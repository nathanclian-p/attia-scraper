In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter dives deep into the topic of hair loss, exploring its relationship with aging and its impact on quality of life. The conversation focuses on androgenic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss in both men and women, and covers the differences in patterns and causes between the sexes. Peter delves into the right timing for treatment, breaking down various options such as minoxidil and finasteride, low-level laser therapy, platelet-rich plasma injections, and more. Additionally, Peter outlines the pros and cons of the two primary hair transplantation methods and concludes with practical advice on selecting the right specialist or treatment team for those facing hair loss.

The impact of hair loss on emotional health [2:15]
General Podcast Focus:
Most podcast episodes and AMA sessions focus on lifespan and healthspan topics.
Today’s topic is hair loss, which doesn’t directly relate to lifespan or healthspan but is a common question from both podcast listeners and patients.
The conversation will address:
Causes of hair loss.
Options to slow down hair loss or treat it once it has occurred.
Summary of available treatments and guidance on choosing the right approach.
How hair loss affects both men and women differently.
How to find a good specialist if treatment is necessary.
For most people, hair loss is noticed in different ways:
Visually, through the thinning of hair density.
Noticing fallen hairs on pillows or in drains.
Relationship Between Hair Loss and Healthspan
Although hair loss may not directly affect lifespan or traditional healthspan factors (physical or cognitive performance), it can still impact quality of life.
But it can cause emotional distress, which ties it to emotional health and, indirectly, to healthspan.
The prevalence, patterns, and causes of hair loss in men and women [5:15]
Prevalence of Hair Loss Across Genders:
Hair loss is common for both men and women, but many people are surprised by how frequently women experience it.
The focus of this discussion is
androgenic alopecia
(AGA), which accounts for about 95% of male hair loss and at least half of female hair loss cases.
Male vs. Female Hair Loss:
Androgenic alopecia is the primary cause of hair loss in men and often in women, but women have other common causes of hair thinning that must be ruled out.
Men: Androgenic alopecia is responsible for almost all cases of hair loss in men.
Women: While androgenic alopecia can cause thinning, other factors, such as pregnancy, menopause, autoimmune conditions, stress, vitamin deficiencies, and medications, play a larger role in women.
Temporary hair loss during and after pregnancy is common, but its inclusion in statistics depends on the context.
Causes of Hair Loss (other than AGA)
Autoimmune conditions.
Psychological stress.
Hormonal changes (e.g., pregnancy, menopause).
Vitamin/mineral deficiencies: Iron, Vitamin D, B12.
Medications: Rare cases linked to statins, antidepressants, antihypertensives.
*NOTE: For most of this episode of the podcast, we’re going to be referring to androgenic alopecia
Prevalence and Age-Related Hair Loss
Prevalence in Men:
Male pattern hair loss (AGA) affects 30-50% of men by age 50.
Virtually all cases are manifest by age 40, though some men can begin experiencing hair loss as early as their late teens or early 20s.
Prevalence in Women:
Female pattern hair loss is surprisingly common, affecting 20-50% of women across their lifespan.
It can begin as early as age 40, but in some cases, it may not start until age 60.
