Sanjay Mehta is a radiation oncologist with over 25 years of experience, and is currently the president of Century Cancer Centers in Houston, Texas (drsanjaymehta.com). In this episode, Sanjay explores the rapidly evolving field of radiation oncology, addressing common misconceptions about radiation exposure. He delves into radiation’s critical role in modern oncology, examining recent advancements that precisely target tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues and reducing side effects, with specific insights into breast, prostate, and brain cancers. Sanjay discusses fascinating international practices involving low-dose radiation therapy for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, and sports injuries, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for wider adoption in the United States. Wrapping up on a lighter note, Peter and Sanjay discuss their mutual passion for cars and reveal how this shared interest first brought them together.

Show Notes
How radiation oncology became a distinct, rapidly evolving medical specialty [2:45]
This is the first time Peter and Sanjay are together not driving
Peter is resisting the urge to talk about cars (until the end)
Sanjay might be one of the most knowledgeable human beings on cars and the founder of MD Motörheads (Facebook group of doctors who are gear heads)
He’s always the bad on to have on the shoulder when you’re contemplating a new set of wheels or a new something for your car
Sanjay is a radiation oncologist
The bread and butter of what Sanjay does as a radiation oncologist is a black box to many people (Peter included)
Peter has much more familiarity with the medical side of oncology than the radiation side
It would be wonderful to understand more as that field has evolved a lot in the last 25 years
It’s one of the youngest fields
It’s not steeped in some of the traditions that surgery and medicine are
It’s rapidly evolving and the technology has changed so much in the last decade or two
When did radiation oncology become its own discipline, with its own set of boards and everything like that?
As a kid growing up in Houston, some of Sanjay’s friends were radiologists
As an elementary school kid, he remembers CT scanning was pretty new in the 80s
In the 70s and prior to that, it was just a fellowship
Radiologists would have a
cobalt-60 machine
that they would train on for a few weeks and you’d do a few easy calculations and do some crude treatments
Radiation oncology really came into its own starting in the 70s and more into the 80s
The
ACR
had a separate carve out
Radiation oncology residency training is completely independent of diagnostics now
It’s an intern year followed by 4 years of radiation oncology
There’s just a little bit of overlap with diagnostics, but not a lot of diagnostic training just because there’s so much to do on the therapeutic side
Defining radiation, ionizing vs. non-ionizing, and common misconceptions about radiation exposure [5:30]
The idea of using low-dose radiation to heal injuries
A lot of people are going to be very interested in this idea
And why aren’t we using low-dose radiation more to heal some of these nagging orthopedic injuries that people have?
What radiation is
We can’t have that discussion without giving people some understanding of what radiation is
Peter wants to do it in a way that’s both rigorous enough that we can really get into some of the science of this
But also get into it gently enough that people that maybe don’t remember high school physics well enough can come along for the ride and not get lost

Radiation
itself, the term itself has got a bit of a negative connotation, but basically it’s part of the
electromagnetic spectrum
Figure 1. The electromagnetic spectrum

Wikipedia
We have everything in the range of increasing energy of photons, which are just particles of light
On the one end you have radio waves and microwaves, and the other end you’ve got ultraviolet
And then you get into X-rays and radio waves
In the middle of all that is the visible spectrum (you’ve got the rainbow, red, green, blue that we can see)
The human eye can only perceive a tiny little narrow spectrum
These are actually wavelengths and energies, which are the very low end energies
Both radio waves and microwaves are what they call
non-ionizing

⇒
The bottom line is that the low energy stuff is non-ionizing and that cannot damage tissue
That goes all the way up to visible light
Then when you start going to the higher energy X-rays, that’s when you get both X-rays as well as ultraviolet light and then the higher particle stuff
