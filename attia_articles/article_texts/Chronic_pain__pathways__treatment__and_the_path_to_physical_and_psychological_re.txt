Sean Mackey is a professor of pain medicine at Stanford University and the director of the Stanford Systems Neuroscience and Pain Lab, where his research explores the neural mechanisms of pain and the development of novel treatments for chronic pain. In this episode, Sean joins Peter for a wide-ranging discussion on the multifaceted nature of pain—as both a sensory and emotional experience—and its evolutionary purpose as a critical survival mechanism. He dives into how pain is transmitted through the nervous system, the different types of pain, and why different individuals perceive pain so differently. Sean shares insights into pain management strategies ranging from medications like NSAIDs and opioids to neuromodulation techniques such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Additionally, this episode explores the interplay between sleep and chronic pain and the psychological and emotional dimensions of pain, and it includes a personal story from Peter about his own experience with pain and how Sean’s expertise helped him more than two decades ago.

We discuss:
The definition of pain, and how our understanding of pain has evolved from a simplistic body-mind separation to a nuanced biopsychosocial model [2:30];

Using fMRI to identify objective biomarkers of pain in the brain [31:30];
The evolutionary role of pain in human behavior and survival [36:00];
How the brain processes and modulates pain signals, Gate Control Theory, the variability in individuals’ pain perception, and effectiveness of neuromodulation techniques like TENS [41:00];
The brain’s influence on pain: the role of emotion, beliefs, sleep, and individual differences in perception and tolerance [53:45];
Peter’s personal journey with chronic back pain, and how the emotional consequences of pain can be more distressing than the pain itself [1:04:30];

The definition of pain, and how our understanding of pain has evolved from a simplistic body-mind separation to a nuanced biopsychosocial model [2:30]
This morning Peter’s wife asked about the topic of today’s podcast and the guest, and when he said Sean Mackey, her face lit up
She’s never met Sean but she’s heard Peter tell a story about his own experience through this
It was then that Peter realized he hadn’t seen Sean since medical school
They met 25 years ago, and Sean played an unbelievable role in bringing Peter back from arguably the brink of what could have been the end of his life
What pain is
There’s nobody listening to us right now who doesn’t know what pain is
Who hasn’t experienced pain
Yet if you ask for a definition of pain, you’d get a lot of using the word to describe the thing, which isn’t truly a definition
If you were trying to explain to a Martian from another planet who doesn’t experience pain, what it is, what would you say?
Formal definition
: an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage
If you think of it as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience is usually tied to something physically happening, but it may not be
⇒
What’s missing in that definition, is that pain is the great motivator
Pain is one of the most primitive experiences going back to single cell organisms
It’s either pain or reward
You’re either being driven towards oxygen, food, sex, or you’re trying to get away from danger
Pain is so wonderful because it’s so terrible
It keeps us alive
Without pain, we would’ve never lived as a species
We have these genetic issues of congenital insensitivity to pain
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience
To understand pain, whether you’re a Martian or you’re a human now, you have to look back in history
Rene Descartes
, 17th century French philosopher, thought to be the father of modern philosophy
Incredible contributions: he brought Cartesian geometry to us, which led to calculus, and he had this dualistic model of pain that he put forward
To his credit, it was the first mechanistic foundation for pain because beforehand pain was thought to be something mystical or religious
It was punishment of the gods
His framework is often illustrated with this famous picture [shown below] of a little boy with his foot in the fire
And there’s a little string from his foot going up into his brain, and it ends up in the pineal gland, which was thought to be uniquely a human area
The idea is the fire pulls on the little string, opens up pores, and the
pineal gland
rings a bell and the boy withdraws his foot

The idea is in this
dualistic model
, there is a complete separation between body and mind
The body is where pain is generated
The mind is where it’s perceived, but the mind is simply a passive receptacle receiving these signals
That model put forward in the 17th century stuck with us for hundreds and hundreds of years, and today it has influenced medical care
It has influenced policy
It’s influenced everything in our society about the way we think about pain
This dualistic model is utterly completely wrong
Yes, Descartes got Cartesian geometry right, but he complete bollocks screwed it up when it came to pain
It’s only been in the last number of decades that we’ve appreciated the nuance of what pain really is
Sean explains about pain, “
Instead of it being under this guise of this separate mind and body, we now appreciate it as this integrated biopsychosocial phenomenon meaning that, and I think this is one of the most important things that I’d like to drive across.
”

Nociception
is a term referring to electrochemical injury signals that occur in the periphery, that what goes on in the body and what goes on in the brain, the experience of pain, they may have nothing to do with each other or very little linkages (and Sean’s going to unpack that)
For hundreds of years, we’re basing our understanding of pain on Rene Descartes’ dualistic model
We still see this in medical care right now
For many, many, years, when Sean talked with the surgeons, they were firmly of the opinion that the amount of pain that a patient had after surgery was related to how much the scalpel cut and how much tissue damage was done
It’s only more in the last 20 or so years that he’s seeing surgeons really embracing this model that
what people bring to the operating room table directly influences how much pain they have
Their early life experiences, all this stuff that Sean will talk about
The latter part of the 19th century brought a couple of other tools to pain
Local anesthetics (from
cocaine
down to
lidocaine
)
General anesthetics (
ether
) ‒ allowed surgeons to cut people without having to hold them down while they screamed
These didn’t shed any new light on understanding pain
They were viewed as a blunting instrument; it didn’t change the model
This has had tragic consequences in the care of people, particularly with
chronic pain
Particularly women with chronic pain who have felt stigmatized, invalidated because absent something that’s obviously wrong out in the body of the periphery, they were just labeled as being histrionic housewives or being told it’s all in their head
Not just women, but also some men as well
That has gotten better with the evolution of our perception or our model into a biopsychosocial model
The biological mechanisms behind how we perceive pain [9:30]
Is there a pain receptor?
Nociceptors
are basically a transducer
It’s a complicated name
If you have an engineering background, you’ll all know that a transducer is simply a device that converts one form of energy into another form of energy
This microphone is converting sound energy into electrical energy
The speakers convert electrical energy back into sound energy
We have these nociceptors that lie in our skin, our soft tissues, our deep tissues, our viscera, and they’re specialized, and they convert different forms of energy into electrochemical impulses
They take pressure; they take heat, cold; they take chemical changes in the form of pH (that can occur during infection)
