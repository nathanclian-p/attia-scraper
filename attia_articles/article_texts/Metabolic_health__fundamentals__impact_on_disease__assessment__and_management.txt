Metabolic Health Compilation
Curated clips, articles, and podcast episodes
Metabolic dysfunction is often overlooked for years, quietly laying the groundwork for chronic disease. But today, we have the tools not only to identify these issues early—well before overt pathology—but also to reverse them, even in cases where conditions like type 2 diabetes are already established. This compilation distills the most impactful insights: how to evaluate your risk, which interventions produce meaningful change, and why metabolic health stands as one of the most important determinants of both

Fundamentals
In this section, we’ve curated clips that explain what metabolic dysfunction actually is. At its core, metabolic dysfunction reflects a progressive breakdown in how the body regulates energy—most often driven by insulin resistance. Left unchecked, it evolves into metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Understanding this continuum is essential if we want to detect problems early and intervene before chronic disease sets in.

Impact
In this section, we’ve selected clips that examine how poor metabolic health contributes to the development of chronic disease. Conditions like cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and kidney disease often share a common metabolic root—longstanding insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation. These aren’t isolated problems; they’re downstream consequences of a disrupted metabolic system. Understanding these links is critical if we want to shift from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.

Assessment
In this section, we’ve curated clips focused on how to assess metabolic health. Peter often emphasizes going beyond standard labs by using tools like the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with insulin measurements, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), measurement of fasting insulin and C-peptide, and advanced lipid panels. These tests offer a clearer picture of how your body handles glucose and insulin over time—long before fasting glucose or HbA1c signal trouble. The goal isn’t just early detection, but earlier intervention.

Management
In this section, we’ve pulled together clips on how to improve and maintain metabolic health over the long term. The strategies are broad but grounded: dietary interventions that lower insulin demand, consistent Zone 2 aerobic training, strength training, sleep optimization, and, when appropriate, time-restricted eating or fasting protocols. Peter emphasizes that the goal isn’t perfection—it’s durability. Sustained metabolic health is less about hacks and more about building a lifestyle that keeps the system resilient, decade after decade.
