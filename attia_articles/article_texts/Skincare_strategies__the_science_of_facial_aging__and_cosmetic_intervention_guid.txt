Tanuj Nakra and Suzan Obagi, two leading experts in aesthetic medicine, join Peter to explore the science of facial aging and skin health as well as the responsibilities physicians face in the world of cosmetic procedures. In this episode, they examine the biological and hormonal drivers of facial aging, the evolutionary and psychological foundations of attractiveness, and the impact of modern media on beauty standards. They discuss the rise in cosmetic procedures among adolescents and the ethical responsibilities of physicians in these cases. The conversation then shifts to a practical, evidence-based guide to skin health—covering the use of mineral sunscreens, retinoids, vitamin C, and tailored skincare routines, as well as the management of acne and the psychology behind aesthetic consultations. The episode culminates in a candid, personal assessment of Peter’s own face, offering a revealing look at what aesthetic medicine can achieve and how to think critically about pursuing it.

Show Notes
Tanuj’s and Suzan’s training and expertise, and the evolving field of aesthetic medicine [4:00]
This is a topic that Peter gets asked a lot about and one that he knows even less than the general public about
It’s super helpful to have not one but two experts on this topic because they each have a different specialty
Tell us a little bit about your training, your background, and what you focus on
Dr. Tanuj Nakra
Tanuj’s core specialty is oculofacial plastic surgery
He trained mostly  at UCLA in eye surgery and in facial surgery
His original background is ophthalmology
Then he did fellowships in ophthalmic plastic surgery and another fellowship in facial cosmetic surgery
His practice is limited to eye and face plastic surgery
That ranges from reconstruction of children, cancer reconstruction for elderly, and all the cosmetic surgeries that we can perform on the face
This includes the nose and neck
Tanuj moved to Austin 16 years ago after training at UCLA and joined a large group here [
TOC Eye and Face
], and he is also faculty of the
Dell Medical School
He is actively involved with academics, teaching, and residents
The practice has two
fellowship programs
“
It’s a real pleasure to be involved in academics because it’s the cutting edge of science, and we like to perform clinical research and in the academic community (which is how I know Suzan) there’s a lot of collaboration amongst specialties, and we have an opportunity to dialogue and further the specialty that we care so much about
.”‒ Tanuj Nakra
Dr. Suzan Obagi
Suzan is a dermatologist by training, she did a fellowship in cosmetic surgery
She is in academic medicine at the
University of Pittsburgh
She’s been there about 24 years ‒ she’s gotten to see the evolution of this entire field
They used to do surgeries and a few collagen injections
Now they have a plethora of tools at their disposal
She trains residents, medical students, and visiting physicians from all over the world
She loves the multi-specialty collaboration
Both guests belong to the
American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery
, and they have a different approach from different specialists, sometimes even on the same procedure
Suzan’s practice focuses on everything with regards to skin rejuvenation, peels, lasers
She does a lot of fat grafting
She does body liposuction, mini face lifts, eye lifts
“
Everything when it comes to the face is about really enhancing the appearance of the skin first, because my feeling is that’s the most important thing that everyone sees
.”‒ Suzan Obagi
When a patient comes in who has not had anything done or doesn’t know about the field, Suzan actually likes that because she can take that opportunity to really educate them and pick the right things for them
Peter jokes, “
I appreciate you noticing I’ve had nothing done.
”
Before the podcast, they were discussing the strategy Peter has taken towards his appearance
There is something about this field of medicine that Peter has such a block in his brain to understanding
He has met Tanuj before: Tanuj helped him with a scar
Peter’s friend
Brett Kotlus
[guest on
episode #13
] introduced them
Peter face planted one morning due to some hypotension and sustained a pretty nice scar that for the most part is largely invisible today (probably in part because his face is leather to begin with)
In part that’s because he did some
5-FU
microabrasion
along with a whole bunch of stuff, and Peter was actually pretty diligent about staying out of the sun for the period of time afterwards
He’s also done a
Botox
treatment, which certainly reduced the wrinkles (obviously it’s long gone)
Peter has taken a strategy towards his appearance that is probably illogical: he ignores it because he doesn’t understand it
He focuses on things he understands
Peter adds, “
I would view it as an enormous win of this podcast if in a few hours, I decided to do something that was sustainable and going to help me look a little better at 62 than I should look. (I’m 52 today).
”
Peter looked at a picture of himself 10 years ago before this podcast, and what a difference 10 years has made
He looks so much worse today
That’s probably not uncommon and would guess that 42 to 52 is a big reduction in appearance
It made him realize that the reduction in the next 10 years will be greater if he doesn’t do something proactive
Peter admits, “
I can’t even bring myself to wash my face before bed.
”
Which his wife finds disgusting
Tanuj and Suzan have their work cut out for them because if Peter can be educated on this, they can change the world
The biology of the aging face [10:45]
We’re going to limit our discussion to the neck up
Why did Peter look better at 42 than 52?
That’s exactly how Suzan’s patients come in; they say, “
I feel like I look tired. I don’t know exactly what’s going on…
”
She uses diagrams of the face of someone who’s 20 and someone who’s in their late 60s to explain the changes
If you look at a diagram of the face with the skin peeled off, you’ll see about 11 different fat compartments in the youthful face [shown in the figure below]
On each side of the face that are plump, they’re robust, they’re giving volume, and they’re giving a padding between the skin and the muscle and the underlying bones

Then you look at someone who’s in their late 60s, and you peel the skin away, and you see a dramatic atrophy in all those fat pads
A few might increase in size, but the vast majority undergo atrophy
