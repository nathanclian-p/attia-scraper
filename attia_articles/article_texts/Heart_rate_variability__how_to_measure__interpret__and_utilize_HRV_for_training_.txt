Joel Jamieson is a conditioning expert who developed
Morpheus
to give people a smarter way to build their conditioning regimen and improve their recovery. In this episode, Joel dives deep into the world of heart rate variability (HRV), explaining its scientific foundation, how it measures the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the various methods of measurement, and how it can guide healthier lifestyle choices and improved training performance. He explores the nuances of HRV calculation, the impact of aging on HRV, and the roles of genetics, exercise, and other lifestyle factors in this process. He also covers Morpheus, the innovative training tool that won Peter over after his initial skepticism, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness in guiding training and optimizing fitness outcomes.

Heart rate variability (HRV): evolution, science, and practical applications of HRV in athletic training [4:00]
Heart rate variability (HRV)
is something everybody has heard of, people have a vague sense of what it is, but once you get beyond a superficial description of it, most people don’t really understand
Certainly people (Peter included) don’t understand how to use the data
Before we dive into that, give folks a bit of your background and what brought you to study this
Joel has been using HRV for 20 years, and it’s really interesting to see the growth of it
He was in his early 20s when he graduated from the University of Washington
He interned there and did strength and conditioning
Then he progressed to the Seahawks to work with the same coaches
A track coach named
Randy Huntington
was the USA Track and Field Jumps coach
He coached
Mike Powell
, who broke Carl Lewis’s long jump world record in 1991
Randy was a tremendous coach and when Joel was talking to him one day, asking him general advice for a young coach, he recommended he contact a guy named Val who would then tell him all about HRV (this was 20 years ago)
Joel met Val at a hotel by the airport where he was instructed to take off his shirt and Val proceeded to pull out a big laptop, plug in wires, attach electrodes to Randy’s chest, ask him about his birthdate and weight
After 3 minutes, Joel sees all this stuff happening on the computer
Val then tells him about his recovery status, his readiness, his metabolic profile, his central nervous system
He explained, “
You’re much more strength oriented and your cardiovascular system’s not very good
” (which was accurate at the time)
20+ years ago, HRV was not something people were aware of
The idea that you could take something out of a laptop, connect it with the body and have any idea physiologically about the athlete was completely new and foreign to Joel
He immediately realized that he needed this
There’s so much of a black box when it comes to fitness
Sometimes he does a workout and gets better and sometimes he doesn’t. Why?
Val explained the history of HRV, and this is interesting because it goes way back to the 1700s (awareness of beat-to-beat intervals)
The Chinese have used pulse medicine for a long time
The Russians were ahead of the game as far as application of HRV
In the 1950s, they were aware that from an
ECG
you could pull out these beat-to-beat intervals and get something more than just heart rate
When they sent the first human being in space (
Yuri Gagarin
), they were able to send back the ECG and some respiratory data and see fundamentally what happened to people when you shot them into space
They saw as soon as he went into space, his HRV went way up
Probably because you have changes in blood pressure, you have less gravity so you don’t have to have as much muscle activity
They started using this in the ‘60s, which is fascinating because it wasn’t seen in Western literature until decades later
They dominated the Olympics in 1980
They had a very elaborate drug program and an elaborate training program
In the mid-80s they started figuring out how to use this tech for sport performance
They put together an engineering team and they started collecting data on thousands of Russian athletes of all levels from their school age kids all the way up to the Olympic athletes
They collected just populational norms
They started building the system that was meant to monitor training and be used for training
They spent years working on this platform, but before they could finish it, the Soviet Union collapsed and the team involved dispersed
By chance, a lot of them were involved in track and field and different sports
They ended up reconvening at a track meet in Eugene and talking about this past project
They decide that they want to get together and keep working on this because they’d never brought to fruition, and they did
That was the first system commercially available for sport and fitness, and this is what Joel was introduced to at the time
The first HRV system
It was a very research heavy, medical type system that was not easy to interpret
Joel didn’t have $35,000 to buy it, but he convinced them to let him help them introduce it to teams across the US and gain some exposure for them
He started using it
It gave you 12 or 14 different metrics of heart rate variability
It required you to connect electrodes to people before you’d measure them
Joel explains, “
That introduction to it ,where I started this whole journey and 20 years of looking at data and coaching people and trying to understand what the data was telling me and how it aligned with all these other metrics, [it] has really just led down this path of how you get to heart rate variability today.
”
He spent the next 20 years coaching with it
Looking at HRV, he opened a gym, he worked with lots of fighters, athletes, different teams, military groups
Methods of measuring HRV: EKG, wrist-based sensors, and more [11:30]
When Joel was first introduced to HRV and it was done off an
EKG
, Peter assumes that 3 leads would be sufficient
You could get it from 3 leads but they used 6
Is EKG still the gold standard for measuring HRV?
