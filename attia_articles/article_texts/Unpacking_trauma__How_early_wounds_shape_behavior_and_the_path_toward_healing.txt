Jeff English is a trauma-focused clinical counselor with extensive experience working with adults, teens, families, and groups across various settings, including career counseling, life coaching, addiction recovery, professional workshops, and private practice. In this episode, Jeff shares insights from his work as a trauma therapist, exploring how moments of perceived helplessness shape behaviors and how adaptive strategies can become maladaptive over time. He discusses the concept of the “trauma tree,” examining its roots (causes) and branches (consequences), and highlights a powerful framework used at the Bridge to Recovery, a residential workshop where Jeff operated for over 8 years. Jeff reflects on the transformative power of group therapy, the role of vulnerability in fostering connection, and the challenges of letting go of control. He also offers practical advice on finding a great trauma therapist, balancing personal growth within relationships, and recognizing when it’s time to seek help.

Defining trauma—a loaded word [3:00]
Talk a little bit about this loaded word of “trauma”
When Peter was first introduced to this idea of trauma, he didn’t know what that meant
Today it’s become such a catchy buzzword, that everybody is traumatized by something
How do you describe trauma as a trauma therapist and as someone who’s been doing trauma therapy for many years?
The
big traumas (“big T”)
are being in war: Vietnam, 9/11 attack, etc.
Within the spirit of the work, really embracing a definition: moments of perceived helplessness, that’s what’s going to activate the limbic system
⇒
Who is to say what one
limbic system
evaluates as helplessness versus another?
That’s when we get into this discovery most people have made of, “
Wow, I think I did experience trauma
.”
Jeff works with clients individually and in groups
He thinks we often make things too complex
A lot of what he does is try to depolarize for folks
Getting into these situations to where we live in this world of “get-over-it, it doesn’t matter”
Versus, like Peter mentioned, perhaps we stay stuck in it
⇒
Moments of perceived helplessness activate the limbic system
Wounding events ‒ one of those would be a tragic event
Life seems to be going one way before this thing happens, and then this thing happens, and life changes and everything is different on the other side of that “big T” event
Versus someone who maybe you could describe it as “a thousand paper cuts” [“little t” events]
Someone growing up, going through childhood, daily being limbically activated, but moments of perceived helplessness
That stuck for Jeff, and it stuck for a lot of clients
The therapeutic process at The Bridge to Recovery: confronting discomfort, embracing vulnerability, and reframing one’s story [5:45]
Peter met Jeff at a place called
The Bridge to Recovery
in December of 2017 (7 years ago)
Peter wrote about it somewhat reluctantly in
Outlive
, but without that chapter, the book was incomplete
How a place like
The Bridge to Recovery
comes to exist, and how therapists like Jeff come to work at places like that
It might be shocking to some, how much group therapy is done at a place like that
When Peter looks back through his journal, it’s amazing how complex it was for him to be able to open up in front of a group
He spent the first few days saying virtually nothing, largely because of that discomfort
In his book, Peter described
The Bridge
as this wonderful, horrible place in the woods of Bowling Green, Kentucky
Some folks call it residential treatment; some people call it trauma camp
Other names Peter wrote down: Camp Misery, The Sadness Factory, and The Tree of Pain
Jeff couldn’t argue with any of those
Jeff describes it as residential treatment for disconnection
Most folks think disconnection sounds vague
When many think of residential treatment, they tend to jump to substance abuse (where people go to get sober)
Jeff explains, “
Disconnection is just the concept that’s used at The Bridge, and one way of disconnecting is substance abuse, but also screens, sex, relationships, ego, anger. So you just take away the substance, take away the word alcohol, and plug in whatever word you want to.
”
The group process
You might have a group of 8 folks, and there might be 3 folks who identify as substance abusers and 2 as workaholics
“
You may disconnect differently than I do, Peter, but the commonality is that, especially when life throws us a curveball, this disconnected version of me seems to come out, jump in my driver’s seat, if you will
.”‒ Jeff English
There’s a big part of Jeff that doesn’t want to give away the secrets ‒ let the magic happen
But you can know everything that’s going to happen, and then you start going through the process, and
discomfort
is what it’s all about
That’s when stuff comes up
That’s the whole idea
Monday is admissions day, and counselors would usually meet the groups by Tuesday
Countless times Jeff has tried to help talk folks off the ledge of leaving
In summary, their reasons are an increase in anxiety (the details differ)
They may say, “
I came to The Bridge and my anxiety was at a 7. Right now I think it’s a 9. I need to get the heck out of here. This place ain’t for me.
”
This is the evidence that
The Bridge
is exactly the right place for them
Peter remembers that first day (Monday) is a very unpleasant day
Explain the objectives of phase 1: The telling of one’s life story
Getting your history straight
Many folks have done it before, but here it’s through the lens of what the counselors introduce as “the trauma tree”
It’s the “what happened to me” story
So many of us for years (sometimes decades) have been telling the story of what’s wrong with me
From the very beginning, the shift, the hope is to move a little bit closer to what happened to me
Not within the spirit of an excuse, but an explanation
It makes sense that I do this thing that I do now
The group process brings up the stuff Jeff calls
“the guards”
Parts therapist will call them protective parts (this isn’t new)
It’s “ego states” (new terminology)
⇒
Guard refers to the protective side of a person that comes up when they get vulnerable
When does someone get vulnerable?
