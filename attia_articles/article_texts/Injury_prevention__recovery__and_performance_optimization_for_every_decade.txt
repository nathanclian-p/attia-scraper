Kyler Brown is a sports rehab chiropractor who specializes in injury recovery, pre- and post-surgical rehabilitation, and guiding clients from rehab back to peak performance. As co-founder of the private training program 10 Squared alongside Peter, Kyler shares his approach to injury prevention and performance optimization—highlighting how overlooked movement patterns can quietly lead to chronic issues over time. He outlines a practical framework for assessing and treating individuals, highlights the importance of understanding movement dynamics and asymmetries, and discusses personalized rehab strategies through real-world case studies. The conversation also explores the psychological side of recovery, including the role of fear and mental barriers in rehabilitation. Kyler shares actionable tools to evaluate movement patterns and implement training strategies that support long-term strength and health.
A companion video series demonstrating exercises for common problem areas—such as the lower back, neck, shoulders, and knees—is available exclusively to subscribers on the show notes page.

The personalized rehab strategy for Peter’s shoulder surgery that sparked creation of a training program called 10 Squared [3:00]
A few years ago, when Peter was in the throes of recovery from shoulder surgery, he and Kyler had this idea to put together 2 things that seemed unrelated
His recovery from an injury
The idea of a Centenarian Decathlon in a marginal decade
[
episode #261
goes into detail about the Centenarian Decathlon]
Peter met Kyler 4 years ago, as soon as he moved to Austin
They worked on preventative stuff:
DNS
and routine maintenance
[
episode #152
goes into detail about DNS]
On the second or third visit, Kyler asked about Peter’s shoulder
And that kicked off this whole conversation because in Kyler’s world, this idea of just doing one technique or providing one service isn’t really a complete approach
Peter had torn his
labrum
before
The diagnosis was made in 2009 when he had his first
arthrogram
done
This is a MRI where prior to you going in the scanner, the radiologist takes a needle about 4 inches long, shoots the needle into the capsule and injects contrast so that it really allows the MRI to show the labrum and how much it’s detached from the
glenoid fossa
It was significantly torn but not as torn as it would be 13 years later
Peter had largely avoided surgery by doing as much as he could to strengthen the rotator cuff
And frankly, he was afraid to have surgery
He didn’t want to trade one problem for another
He didn’t want to trade want to trade pain and instability for immobility
Folks listening may recall his discussion with the amazing surgeon
Alton Barron
on the podcast [
episode #232
] who ultimately did the repair
What Peter was most impressed by in that experience was that Kyler and Alton started working as a team
Talk a little about what you guys did 8 weeks prior to Peter’s shoulder surgery
One of the things as a rehab professional that Kyler really appreciated was how Alton didn’t want to just cinch down that joint to where his liability was so covered that that shoulder would be strong, but then have Peter lose a ton of function
One of the key things that Alton did was he put the staples and the sutures in the right places to where that shoulder would be functional (he did just the right amount)
And Kyler worked with Peter to get his shoulder well before more significant structural compromise
It’s a really important window to do so
Kyler remembers that conversation ‒ Peter had a date several months out where he was like, “
I’m going to have to use my arm a lot. I need to be strong.
”
Peter wanted to be able to hunt in September
So the surgery needed to be no later than March
It was January, and the question was should he do the surgery right away or use 2 months to prehab?
How did you think about that question?
That conversation was one of Kyler’s favorites because he’s done this before where if we know the big picture goal as well as the near term surgical date, and then we reverse engineer
Okay, I want to check off a certain amount of things preoperatively to where that joint is ready
Essentially in the most simple terms, what you’re looking for in that situation, is you want to make all the muscles around the shoulder just awesome
Especially with the shoulder because it’s such a mobile joint
But we need to do so in a way that doesn’t make the surgery more complicated or injure you more
He combined a lot of things
Technology like BFR [blood flow restriction discussed in
episode #179
]
Aggressive approaches on core stability
The way the scapula interacts with ribs and all these things have an effect on how the shoulder moves
If the mobile shoulder that has a torn labrum isn’t stable and doesn’t have a support infrastructure around it, you’re always going to ask for more pain
Once things were healing from the surgery itself, all those other ancillary things were actually functioning really well
So now we only had to really target the shoulder itself because the rest of the human was really strong and ready
What Peter remembers
How much rotator cuff work he did ahead of time, particularly around
supraspinatus
He got that muscle as strong as possible in 8 weeks
Anyone who’s gone through that type of rehab knows it’s uncomfortable
You’re burning a tiny muscle that’s not used to working that hard
“
The second thing that I remember and hands down the most important thing was what you and Alton decided to do postoperatively completely shattered everyone’s understanding of what we do with these patients.
”‒ Peter Attia
Peter didn’t have a slap tear, his labrum was hanging on by a thread
Traditionally a surgeon’s primary objective is to make sure that is never unstable again
Cincy it down really tight
The patient will be in a sling for 4-6 weeks, and that’s going to give it plenty of time to heal
But you’ll never regain mobility, never regain the healthy range of motion, and you’ll probably atrophy away
⇒
Alton’s goal was to have Peter out of a sling in 24 hours
Kyler points out, “
The broader picture here is what we touched on, the liability. And it’s really difficult for modern physicians and rehab pros to integrate.
”
Professional sports try to achieve this as well, but they have time constraints and all these other constraints with how many people they’re working with
Ignoring all those layers, the most important thing is Alton and Kyler had these conversations in detail and Alton was really specific about, “
Okay, did we get the training we talked about? Is that supraspinatus, the serratus anterior, all these other muscles that help stabilize? Are those really good?
”
Kyler had some metrics he was able to discuss with Alton, and Alton felt confident in the stability of Peter’s shoulder
The decision about no sling was based on the preparation they did and what they knew
The other thing was Peter followed everything to a T
“
One of the big complications in rehab (athlete or not) is are people following the rules?
”‒ Kyler Brown
If we take this individual out of a sling, are they going to forget about it and all of a sudden go reach for the cereal or are they going to follow the rules?
Peter was definitely a rule follower
So Alton and Kyler had high confidence in minimizing the risk
Peter learned a lot the hard way from his first orthopedic surgery in 2000
He’s not even convinced he received post-operative instructions
And if he did, he didn’t read them
He was breaking every rule there were
Peter’s labrum repair surgery
The stakes were higher here in a way
Peter was very mindful
When you have surgery, you tend to go on YouTube to learn all about it
He wanted to see everything: the post-operative, the rehab process
Post-surgery exercise
One of the big milestones you see for people with labral surgery is when they basically can dangle the arm and rotate a light weight
Alton was really clear, “
You’re not going to be doing that for a while. We’re talking about range of motion without stress on the repair
.”
Very early on pre-operatively and post, we were able to do very gentle but targeted
isometrics
where there wasn’t complexity in the joint itself, but we were loading the tissues in a very articulate and specific way
And that’s how you again put the support structure around it
Kyler describes as the roll cage in a car, we want all the muscles around that to be ready to absorb force
So those joint structures that are getting the staples or whatever else in there aren’t stressed
We don’t want to yank on those things while they’re healing
Training for the marginal decade: why precision and purpose are essential for quality of life [11:00]
In parallel to this, Peter continued to refine his thinking around the idea that we’re all going to have this marginal decade one day
