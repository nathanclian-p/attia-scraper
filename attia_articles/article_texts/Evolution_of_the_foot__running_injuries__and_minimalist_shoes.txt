Irene Davis is the founding Director of the Spaulding National Running Center at the Harvard Medical School. In this episode, Irene describes how her research of biomechanics and clinical work with running injuries, as well as research by others, has shaped her views on maintaining body alignment and foot health. Irene discusses her argument for the role of modern footwear in running-related injuries and how minimalist footwear helps resolve the subsequent biomechanical issues.

Irene’s path to her Ph.D., her entry into physical therapy, and her interest in biomechanics [3:20]
The path to and focus of Irene’s Ph.D.
She originally wanted to be in the FBI, but at the time, women weren’t allowed
Classes in exercise science eventually led her to completing a degree in physical therapy
Her curiosity led her to complete a master’s degree and Ph.D. in biomechanics
She completed her Ph.D. at Penn State under
Dr. Peter Kavanaugh
, who is a pioneer of running mechanics
Irene’s early work as a physical therapist
Watching her cousin go through physical therapy after being paralyzed in a car accident inspired her to become a physical therapist herself
She started her physical therapy career in spinal cord rehab
After starting graduate school, she shifted to outpatient physical therapy
What shifted Irene’s interest towards biomechanics
Quadriplegics need to move their entire body with just 25% of their muscle – they need to learn to use their bodies in atypical ways
How Irene’s thinking about the use of orthotics has changed [7:15]
Early in Irene’s career, she was a proponent of
orthotics
She prescribed orthotics as a physical therapist
She taught about orthotics at the University of Delaware
She simply believed that some people had feet that were incapable of supporting themselves
Irene’s thinking began to change based on her research and when the book
Born to Run
was published
Her research led her to realize that people who land on their heels while running incur greater impact forces, and that footwear influences these forces
This, plus the message in book Born to Run, made her reflect on the traditional approach of physical therapy for other areas of the body –
removing
support to encourage patients to improve their intrinsic ability
The permanent nature of orthotics is the opposite of this approach
Irene says,
“And it kind of brought me back to when I was a physical therapist in rehab, where we would try to take away as much support and bracing to our patients, even wheelchairs, a lower back, less lower extremity bracing so that they would use what they had. And yet my thinking in terms of feet was completely opposite. … We don’t brace anything else permanently if you have an orthopedic problem.”
Despite the common thinking that we should be prescribing a shoe type based on an individual’s need for support, a
study done by Joe Knapik
on thousands of military personnel found that there was no difference in injury rate

Irene Davis, Ph.D.
Irene is a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. She’s also the founding director of the Spaulding National Running Center—one of the premier centers in the United States devoted exclusively to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of running injuries in runners of all ages and abilities. Irene holds two bachelor’s degrees, one in exercise science from the University of Massachusetts, and one in physical therapy from the University of Florida. She then went on to earn her master’s degree in biomechanics from the University of Virginia, before finally going on to get her PhD in biomechanics from Penn State.
