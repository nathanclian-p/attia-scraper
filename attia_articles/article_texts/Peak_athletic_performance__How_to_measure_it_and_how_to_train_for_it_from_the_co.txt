Olav Aleksander Bu is an internationally renowned sports scientist acclaimed for his coaching prowess with elite athletes spanning a diverse range of sports disciplines. In this episode, Olav delves deep into the intricacies of VO2 max and its profound impact on performance. They explore the relationship between VO2 max and ATP production, energy efficiency, and power, as well as the impact of low-intensity training on VO2 max. The conversation extends to Olav’s experiences pushing the boundaries with high-performance athletes and the data driven interventions he uses to improve performance. They also dissect the role of lactate threshold, discuss other important metrics to track, and explore the exciting possibility of utilizing a portable VO2 testing device as a practical alternative to traditional lab-based assessments.

Olav’s background, expertise in exercise physiology, coaching experience, and interest in the extremes of human capability [4:15]
What we are about to discuss today fascinates Peter to no end, but more than that, Olav is someone who brings a level of expertise that is so high that it really allows Peter to engage at a level of curiosity that he rarely gets to
Tell people who you are, what you do, and the types of athletes that you work with
Olav grew up on a farm on the west coast of Norway
He had to participate in a lot of work at a farm when he was a kid against his will
He saw neighbors and others playing and he would would very much like to do that as well
A long time ago, he started to really appreciate all the hardship
As a kid, he developed a very keen interest for technology and was extremely curious
He liked to really pick things apart and understand how things were put together
Fascinated about everything from the universe and rockets and so on
Living at the farm, he got the possibility to pick apart a lot of machineries and things to see how they worked
Being with animals on the farm, he has a strong connection with animals
As he started to grow older, he became very interested in things that were extreme
Extreme sports is something that resonates a lot with him
There is probably no extreme sport that he hasn’t participated in on an okay level
He earned a degree in electro techniques and went on to engineering
He was not cut out for working 8-4
He was more interested in entrepreneurship
He liked to build things in a new way, new things, solve things that nobody has solved before
Extreme things fascinate him
An event happened in 2011
This was after he started his second company
We had used a helicopter to get into the mountains
Half of his family died on this trip, and it made a shift in his life
He got even more into sports
He began to combine the field of exercise physiology and his strength in technology, and he began research
A lot of research happens in a laboratory setting where you are taking out components and looking at how it reacts, but rarely are we able to transform that back into humans in a way that makes the same difference
He began to use technology to study elite athletes in the setting where they normally exercised, and he used that to continue to drive performance
Today, 3 of his athletes hold records in triathlon: short course, long course Olympic medal, World Championship medal, short course, the Ironman World Championship, 70.3 and full distance from Kona and St. George last year
Kristian Blummenfelt
,
Gustav Iden
, and Ken Jenina
Olav always learns from them because he’s very curious about how they feel and how they perceive things
While there’s a lot we can measure with data, there’s still a lot of things we can’t measure
You need that context
Today he’s building a company and scaling these companies using AI
The company called
Entalpi
uses large numerical models, large language models
He likes physics ‒
enthalpy
and
thermodynamics
are fundamental laws that humans can’t escape
On the other side of things, Olav works to coach coaches at the highest levels
Olympic level, world level
The processes of energy conversion within the human body and its implications for performance [9:30]
Peter remarks that the triathlete is a remarkable athlete in several levels
He/she must be very good in 3 disciplines that are related, but quite distinct
Different body types: if you look at the world’s best swimmers, the world’s best cyclists, and the world’s best runners, they actually have quite different physiology, depending on the distances they race and certainly different methods of training
The triathlete therefore has to be really respected because they have to be almost world-class in each of those things to be world-class in their sport and their physiology as a result of that is remarkable
There are so many things that we’re going to talk about today, including temperature management, energy expenditure, energy consumption
Peter wants to make sure that the listener is able to follow where we go
We’re going to get into some really serious weeds
We’re going to talk about
MCT transporters
for
shuttling lactate
out of cells and all of those things [in a future episode]
As Peter and Olav are sitting here right now having a discussion, and their bodies are converting chemical energy into electrical energy, back into chemical energy
It requires the substrates of oxygen and hydrocarbons to do that
Can you explain in a little bit of detail exactly what that process looks like for us right now as we’re sitting here under obviously a very low physiologic demand?
