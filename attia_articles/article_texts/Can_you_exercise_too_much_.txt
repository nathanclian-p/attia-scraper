In this ‚ÄúAsk Me Anything‚Äù (AMA) episode, Peter dives deep into the question of whether there is such a thing as ‚Äútoo much exercise.‚Äù He explores the theoretical ‚ÄúJ-curve‚Äù relationship between exercise and longevity, whereby mortality risk declines with increasing activity levels only to see an uptick above a certain exercise volume threshold. While Peter maintains that exercise is perhaps the single most important tool we have to live longer and live better, he explains the challenges involved in identifying an optimal dose. He takes a hard look at studies‚Äîmany of which have contradictory results‚Äîto highlight major limitations in methodology and how readers could be misled. Additionally, he discusses the rare, but real, risks associated with extreme levels of physical activity and concludes by weighing the benefits against the risks of exercise.

How exercise reduces risk for all-cause mortality [2:30]
Overall question of today‚Äôs episode
:
What is the optimal dose of exercise for longevity?
Four pillars of exercise:
1) Stability (the foundation)
2) Strength
3) Zone 2 aerobic training
4) Zone 5 (high intensity, e.g., HIIT)
See
AMA #12
How much should one be working out?
When you look at the literature, it doesn‚Äôt quite agree with each other
For example,
Alex Hutchinson
,
Mike Joyner
, and
AMA #27
don‚Äôt necessarily agree with the ‚ÄúJ-curve‚Äù argument whereas in the
James O‚ÄôKeefe episode
he discusses his research which talks about a J-curve
The core questions for today include
:
What is the optimal dose of exercise for longevity?
And can you do too much?
We‚Äôre NOT really looking at what is the minimum dose?

Why explore whether there‚Äôs validity to there being ‚Äútoo much exercise‚Äù?
‚ÄúEven if majority of people aren‚Äôt in the situation where they‚Äôre butting up against potential limits of exercise in terms of crossing from being benefit to risk, I think it‚Äôs a very important question nevertheless‚Äù says Peter
And it might speak to some of the mechanistic insights around exercise
And of course for those people who do want to push the limits, it probably gives us some insight as well.
How is exercise so beneficial, not only for our health span, but also for our lifespan:

@peterattiamd
Why is exercise so important and why should people make the time for it and put the effort in to understand this?
There‚Äôs really no need to spend time discussing this beyond just stating that regardless of which chronic disease you‚Äôre looking at, whether it be ASCVD, cancer, Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, all cause mortality, it doesn‚Äôt matter
Exercise is going to reduce the toll of mortality across all of those things
Some of the mechanisms by which it does it:
It can improve lipids
It can reduce inflammatory markers.
It can reduce flow mediated shear stress in arteries
Much of the benefit in cancer comes through the metabolic benefits of exercise
we know for example that the second leading environmental or modifiable risk of cancer after smoking is in fact obesity
It‚Äôs really less the adiposity of obesity that‚Äôs the problem, and the metabolic consequences of obesity that are found in many, but not all obese patients
Diabetes is probably one of the most clear places where you just dramatically see an improvement.
The improvement has to do with glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity within the muscle
‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt any ambiguity here
‚Äù says Peter

What is the relation between exercise and longevity?
Background
:¬† At the most basic level, physical activity increases blood flow throughout the body, improving energy and nutrient transport in tissue. Improving physical fitness can be achieved by performing exercises, which are planned, structured physical activities that require bodily exertion, and has been shown to have numerous health-positive effects on lifespan (quantity of life) and healthspan (quality of life), listed below:

Defining the metric called ‚ÄúMET‚Äù and how it‚Äôs useful for evaluating different exercises [7:45]
MET stands for metabolic equivalent of task
It‚Äôs basically an energy currency in the body
One MET is the energy cost of being alive at rest
One MET is equivalent to 3.5 milliliters per minute, per kilogram of oxygen utilization, and that relationship for the most part just holds
In other words, if you are doing 10 METs of exercise, you are consuming 35 milliliters of oxygen per minute, and that becomes relevant as we start to think about VO
2
max
How many METs do you get doing various things? (some approximate examples)
