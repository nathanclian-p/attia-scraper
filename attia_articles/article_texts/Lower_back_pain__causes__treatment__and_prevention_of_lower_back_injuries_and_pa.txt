Peter’s experience with debilitating back pain [3:30]
Stuart read Peter’s book [
Outlive
] and changed his behavior
A few years ago, Stuart’s family doctor (who is one of his former students) did his blood work, and found he was just on the edge of needing
Crestor
or
Lipitor
His physician suggested, “
Let’s run the experiment,
”
Stuart loves to work hard physically and finish it off with a beer, which 6 days out of 7, he’s denying himself of that
Long story short, the experiment paid off, and he’s sleeping a little better and is a little more mentally sharp
Peter thinks maybe he doesn’t have to be quite as restrictive
He doesn’t necessarily believe in denying all the pleasures of life
Why the topic of biomechanics for a healthy back is of great interest to Peter
The very abridged version of the story is Peter grew up doing all sorts of really aggressive things and really took to powerlifting when he was about 14
He found himself reasonably strong for a little scrawny kid
Between about the ages of 14-19, he really pushed
He couldn’t bench press to save his life, but seemed pretty strong in a squat and deadlift
He ignored any claims his parents made that maybe he was doing a little too much
Truthfully, Peter had no formal instruction
He was just watching the other grown men in the gym who were insanely powerful and trying to replicate what they were doing
Peter had no sense of what he was doing
Fast-forward to age 21, and he’s rowing crew, and for the first time in his life he experienced lower back pain
This really rocked his world, because he always thought that people who got lower back pain were people who did nothing
He never thought that someone who was as active as he was could get it
For about 2 weeks, the back pain completely disabled him
He could barely get around
As a college student, he didn’t really have any resources and didn’t know what to do
This was in the summer, so he didn’t have classes, but he had to stop rowing
Otherwise he was able to work
The back pain went away and he thought everything was fine
He never thought about it again until the summer 3 years later, when he was 24 years old
He was in San Diego riding his bike up the steepest hill, a patch of mountain called Mount Soledad
There’s a section of this thing where you make a sharp right turn, and at that moment it’s about a 25 degree pitch
Peter experienced this very sudden pain in his lower back and like a typical idiot, just kept on pushing and climbing to the top and finished the ride
But then went on to experience the exact same thing: for two weeks he was debilitated and couldn’t do a thing other than lay around and walk, but then it got better and he just forgot all about it
Fast-forward to the big one
This occurred in Peter’s 3rd year of medical school
He’s now 27 years old, and the remarkable consistency of this is not lost on him
It is every 3 years by the summer, the summer of ‘94, ‘97 and 2000
He’s riding his bike from class to the gym, he gets to the gym, hops off his bike to lock it up, and all of a sudden he feels that same familiar, horrible pain in his back
But this time it’s a little worse than the previous 2 bouts
It was so bad that he did something he’d never done before: he decided not to go into the gym
He just slowly got back on the bike and limped his way back to his apartment and wasn’t able to do anything other than just lay in bed
He assumed he’d be fine the next morning and he woke up the next morning and actually couldn’t get out of bed
Luckily, Peter and his roommate each had separate phone lines, so Peter was able to call him from his room
So began a really painful journey over the next couple of weeks where the only place he could find relief was bent at 90-degrees forward, where he would basically stand and bend over the nurses station
By this point, he was doing clinical rotations and as every good, gunning medical student knows, there was no way he was going to miss a day
He would drag himself to the hospital each day and somehow manage to get through
The nurses and residents took pity on him, and they were injecting him full of
Toradol
This went on for a month
It got so bad that eventually the pain progressed from just being debilitating in his lower back to a nerve pain that felt like his foot was being skinned
It was interesting in that the pain in his lower back started to subside as it was replaced by the feeling of his left foot being skinned from the bottom
This story gets worse and worse before getting better, but needless to say, Peter has a graduate degree in back pain
There is a happy ending to this story, which is after this bout (which took a year to resolve), he made it a mission to figure out what was going on
Fortunately, any time he’s had back pain since then, it has been a very, very short-lived experience
Peter plants one last seed that we can come back to before we jump into this
If a reasonable person were to look at an MRI of Peter’s spine today at age 50, you would say, “
How does he walk? This person must be in so much pain he doesn’t know his name.
”
But for the most part, Peter is not in pain at all
Occasionally, he gets a little tight in his lower back, but he doesn’t have radicular pain
He’s not limited in anything he does
This suggests that the correlation between the image of his back on an MRI and his symptoms is pretty light
Peter adds, “
The fact that you’re smiling so much as I tell you this story tells me not that you’re taking pleasure in my pain, but rather the familiarity of my story.
”
Exactly, Stuart has been doing pattern recognition
There’s only one thing that would account for the repeated acute episodes
Stuart recognizes that in the interim between each episode, Peter was quite fine
Then it shifted to a ridiculous pain and now he’s at the stage of life where it’s more an occasional grumpiness when he crosses what we call the “tipping point”
Stuart asks, “
Did the pain go to your foot, Peter?… Big toes or little toes?
”
Yes, it was burning pain that was like the bottom of the foot was being skinned
There’s one detail Peter should have shared that might explain this: when he finally had surgery, it turned out that he had a free fragment that was about 5 cm long from the L5 S1 disc
That free fragment had broken off
Stuart was going to guess this
He was going to ask which foot
The 5th route goes to your big toe
The unbearable pain Peter was having presumably was because that free fragment was parked on the
S1
nerve root
Even though it ended up taking 2 surgeries to get that out, and those surgeries ended up causing more damage that needed more repair (that turned into a journey of 1000 cuts)
He was on the road to recovery
The radicular pain seemed to be directly a result of the S1 nerve root
Stuart is smiling because Peter told him exactly what the pain mechanism was
He knew it was a disc switch an open fissured disc bulge
It would be on the side of his foot, right or left
Stuart asks, “
What foot was it?
”
It was the left
Stuart explains, “
You had a posterior left-sided, biased open, fissured disc bulge that would open and close as a function of the flexion postures bending down to lock your bicycle.
”
Before we get into the mechanisms, let’s walk through the anatomy of the back
Anatomy of the back: spine, discs, facet joints, and common pain points [14:45]
Peter remarks, “
You could almost argue it’s a miracle we don’t get more injured even though the frequency with which we do is intense
.”
Stuart would almost argue the opposite
There was a TV show where they asked various experts around the world, “
If you got to re-engineer your particular area… How would you re-engineer it and make it better?
”
Stuart was the spine guy, and they had a cardiac person, an endocrine person
Every expert said they couldn’t, it was perfect
Every system in your body comes with a trade-off, and there are rules that manage that trade-off
The spine
This spine is a series of vertebrae forming a flexible rod
This allows us to dance and move and procreate, tie our shoes, and do all of these wonderful things
But at some point now, say are picking your child out of the crib, you reach across the crib, gather your child, pull them in
If you had a flexible rod (consider a series of stacked oranges) it would fall apart
You need a flexible rod that you can then stiffen to bear load
You cannot push rope, but you can push stone, or in this case an I-beam to bear load
All of these things [a flexible rod that can stiffen to bear load] are necessary to have a functional spine
