Tom Dayspring is a world-renowned expert in clinical lipidology and a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Tom explores the foundations of atherosclerosis and why atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide for both men and women. He examines how the disease develops from a pathological perspective and discusses key risk factors, including often-overlooked contributors such as insulin resistance and chronic kidney disease. He breaks down the complexities of cholesterol and lipoproteins—including LDL, VLDL, IDL, and HDL—with an in-depth discussion on the critical role of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the development of atherosclerosis. Additionally, he covers the importance of testing various biomarkers, the impact of nutrition on lipid levels, and the vital role of cholesterol in brain health, including how cholesterol is synthesized and managed in the brain, how it differs from cholesterol regulation in the rest of the body, and how pharmacological interventions can influence brain cholesterol metabolism.

Defining atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): development, risks, and physiological impact [2:45]
We’re here to talk about ASCVD, cardiovascular disease
There aren’t many people who heard our first podcast series together
[the 5-part series is listed in the see the “selected links” section at the end of these notes]
Peter still gets many notes from people who are just discovering that or who listened to it way back
That discussion is a little bit intimidating for someone who’s trying to understand this topic
Today, Peter wants to bring a little bit of brevity to what they discussed then and also update people on all the things that have changed in the past 6 years
Define what is meant by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
⇒
That’s a very specific type of a vascular disease, and that means arteries throughout your body acquire a pathology: deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall
If you don’t have cholesterol in your artery wall, you don’t have atherosclerotic heart disease
We have many arteries in our body and some are much more afflicted than others
The arteries of most concern are the smaller ones supplying our heart and brain
Because those are essential organs that need a profuse blood flow with all the nutrients and oxygen in the blood
The lumen of the
cerebral arteries
is so small: it’s like the dot of a pencil, so it doesn’t take much to affect the blood flow that’s going through it
Over time, with this deposition of cholesterol, 2 things that can happen
1 – It can build up, and the artery lumen starts to narrow-narrow, which would interrupt the blood flow
2 – Probably more often is the deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall, and those collections are called
plaque
That plaque can become very inflamed and rupture or erode, and that sets off the
coagulation system
in the arteries, which rapidly cause narrowing or obstruction of that coronary artery
Atherosclerosis is the deposition of cholesterol in the artery wall
How did this happen?
The artery is not over-synthesizing cholesterol
Tom’s joke is, “
It’s a dump job
,” somebody brought cholesterol into that artery wall
Peter’s summary
Arteries come in all shapes and sizes
The largest is the aorta coming off the heart, running up in an arch to supply the vessels of the head and then down into the abdomen where every artery of the body arises
It’s not that the arteries of the heart are uniquely susceptible to this process you just described as atherosclerosis, it’s 2 things that are conspiring against us
1 – Very small arteries: it doesn’t take a significant amount of obstruction to create ischemia (a technical term for when oxygen is no longer able to perfuse the tissue)
2 – It happens to afflict an artery that is specifically sensitive to the demands of oxygen
Peter remembers explaining this to his daughter’s 7th-grade class
He came in to do a dissection, and explained part of the reason we don’t have “butt attacks” and we have heart attacks is that the glute muscles are not quite as sensitive to oxygen, and there were many forms of collateralization
Of course, what everyone remembered was “butt attacks”
Brain and heart have this issue where tiny blood vessels are very susceptible to collateralization
And catastrophic things happen
1 – The gradual occlusion of the arteries is probably what more often leads people to complain of chest pain when under demand
Such as climbing the stairs or when at the gym
Under normal circumstances, they don’t feel it
If they take a
nitroglycerine
, everything goes away
(we’ll talk about why all of that’s happening in a moment)
2 – A plaque ruptures causing complete occlusion of a coronary artery
That’s really a frightening scenario
The clotting system of the body responds in the way that it should respond when damage occurs
For example, if you cut your skin
But this turns out to be the worst thing the body could have done
This clotting response is what creates a sudden occlusion, and in an ironic way, the body kills itself
If that occurs in the wrong part of the anatomy of the heart, that person will be dead within a matter of minutes if an intervention is not performed
The brain and heart can’t go very long without nutrients
The bigger arteries that are bringing in blood to the brain are pretty asymptomatic until they are 75, 80% occluded
At which point those organs are deprived of the nutrients they need
This can build up for a long time without you knowing it
At least if you report chest pain, you will get diagnosed in time to do something about it
⇒
This is different from a plaque rupture where you’ve got 4 minutes for somebody to dial 911 and hopefully somebody can give you CPR until you can get and take a
clot buster
The pathogenesis of ASCVD: the silent development over decades, and the importance of early detection for prevention of adverse outcomes [10:45]
The timeline of events
Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in the US and globally, of both men and women
This is largely viewed as a disease of the elderly
Does that give us any insight into the time horizon of this disease or the pathophysiology?
It clearly does
If the deposition of cholesterol is the problem, and you got your cholesterol checked and it’s very high, you don’t have to rush out to see a cardiologist to check your arteries that day, because
it takes a long, long time for this cholesterol deposition to occur
These are very small molecules
The way it’s being deposited in your artery wall: they’re very, very tiny dump trucks carrying cholesterol
“
It takes decades for this plaque to finally get to a point where it’s noticeable on some diagnostic image. Certainly, it would take even longer for symptoms to occur, and everything. So, it’s a slow-slow process.
”‒ Tom Dayspring
But we know this is occurring, basically, from childhood on
There are pediatric studies (
PDAY
,
Bogalusa Heart Study
) where young children have died of this or that, and they get autopsied and they have fatty streaks in their aorta at ages 4, 5, 7, and 8
We know from autopsy studies of military personnel who, unfortunately, get killed in their job, that these young men, many of them robust, in great shape, have subclinical atherosclerosis
But none of them are dropping dead of heart attacks while they are serving in the military, with rare exception
The point is, it takes a long, long time
Most of the heart attacks occur after age 40 (in men and women)
Tom explains, “
We are recognizing now, the real opportunity is to diagnose who might be having cholesterol deposition at a much younger age when we can just arrest it with various modalities.
”
Peter’s story from medical school (almost 30 years ago)
In the 1st year of medical school, the pathology professor asked, “
What’s the most common presenting sign of myocardial infarction?
”
Of course, every medical student put up their hand and went through the litany of symptoms that you might have; chest pain, shortness of breath, left shoulder pain, nausea, etc.
He said, “
No, it’s actually sudden death
.”
That was true at the time
It’s not still true today, but it’s close
⇒
The last thing Peter read suggested <50% of people’s first
MI
will be a fatal one
Do you happen to know the most recent stats on that?
No, but it’s still quite high
The majority do survive, but it’s got to be close to 40% that just don’t have that opportunity
To think that only 25, 30 years ago, that number was north of 50%
The other statistic Peter has shared before, but it always bears repeating
⇒
If you take all of the men who are going to suffer a
major adverse cardiac event [MACE]
, 50% of them will experience their first event before the age of 65
MACE includes heart attack, stroke, cardiac death, etc.
That’s a pretty big number
And 33% of women in the same boat will experience their first event before the age of 65
Peter adds, “
The older I get, the younger 65 feels… I don’t think of 65-year-olds as old people anymore.
”
50% of men and a third of women who are ultimately suffer a cardiac event will suffer their first one (potentially fatal) before age 65
This puts in perspective the temporality of this condition
Peter’s summary
This is a disease that begins at birth
This is largely established through autopsy studies where children, teenagers, people in their 20s die for other reasons; car accidents, homicides, war; and in the process of doing an autopsy, we see the early stages of atherosclerosis
The evidence is quite conclusive that this is a disease process that might be inevitable to our species, if we live long enough
What might separate the people who never get it (or the people who die from something else at old age versus the people who do), simply has to do with the rate of the accelerator and the rate of the brake application, vis-à-vis, these modifiable and non-modifiable risks
Tom’s addendum on how early this can start
There are
fetal autopsy studies
in mothers who have familial hypercholesterolemia, and when they look at the little fetus’ heart, they actually see the beginning of plaque development
Figure 1. Lipid accumulation in fetal aortas
.
It occurs early, and this is why pediatric guidelines have now at least encouraged lipid testing in the pediatric age group, probably age 8 or 9
You don’t wait until you are 40 or 50
Even though we can still help that patient
We are moving into what’s called “
primordial prevention
” ‒ discover the risk factors early, and whatever ones you can modify earlier rather than later is the time to do it
