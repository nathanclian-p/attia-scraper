As many of you know, I had shoulder surgery in March 2022. I was recently given clearance to expand my range of motion. I thought it would be helpful to film my entire week 9 post-op PT session with
Kyler Brown
where we walk through 11 shoulder exercises.
Remember, these exercises are great even if you’re not recovering from surgery!
In this video, we discuss:
00:00 – Introduction
05:15 – Isometric Shoulder Extension
05:47 – Isometric Shoulder Flexion
06:30 – Isometric Shoulder External Rotation
08:33 – Assisted Flexion/Supination with Core Activation and Diaphragmatic Breathing
09:59 – Ipsilateral Rotation With Banded Hip and Shoulder Facilitation
13:23 – Bilateral Banded External Rotation (3 hand positions)
15:38 – Kickstand RDL with External Rotation Isometric the Shoulder
17:28 – Reverse Lunge with Isometric Row
18:40 – Isometric Cuff walk-outs (Increases load tolerance without motion to the joint)
20:35 – Rotator Cuff Eccentrics
22:20 – Rotator Cuff Eccentric with Drop sets
