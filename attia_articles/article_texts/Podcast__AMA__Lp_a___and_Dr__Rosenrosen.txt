Bob Kaplan, my head analyst, had the opportunity to drink all of my espresso while he “asked me anything.”
Alcohol, best lab tests, how to select an MD, racing, career questions, diet, exercise, wearables, and learning processes
are some of the questions we got to, courtesy of a lot of Twitter questions. We also went on a nerd safari in
the land of Lp(a)
, discussing some of the ins and outs of this lipoprotein. (If you’re looking for more information on the topic in the meantime,
this open access article
by
Sam Tsimikas
is a good source.)
Also, in one of the most thoughtful gestures, Bob gave me a very special gift: a new directory, 24 x 36, no less, for my practice. This will not only benefit me and my patients,
but anyone who is a fan of Fletch
