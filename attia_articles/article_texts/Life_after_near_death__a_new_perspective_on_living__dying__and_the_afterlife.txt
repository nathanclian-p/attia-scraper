How Sebastian’s near-death experience shaped his thinking about mortality and gave him a reverence for life [3:00]
Peter found Sebastian’s latest
book
to be really a fantastic book
It’s hard to describe the experience of reading it
It’s so beautiful it can almost bring you to tears in certain sections because there are the stories within it that sort of tell us about our mortality
Peter is curious if others have explained their reaction to Sebastian
Which is you can feel so incredibly insignificant reading this, which is actually a nice thing
It makes this whole thing (death) seem a little less scary
Our insignificance in the cosmos does take the pressure off
We don’t mean anything and that’s both terrifying and liberating
One of the things Sebastian talks about in the book is a kind of reverence for life
It’s quite hard to find one’s way to that reverence in the busyness of daily life in our modern society without having been terrified
After effects of Sebastian’s near-death experience
Once Sebastian was terrified by almost dying, the flip side of that terror was
reverence
And he has found it quite easily after that
At one point after his near death experience, he had a lot of
psychological struggles
, and his wife asked, “
Sebastian, do you feel lucky or unlucky that you almost died? I mean, not that you survived (of course you’re lucky), but that it happened at all. If you could go back and push a button, have it not happen, would you push that button?
”
He honestly didn’t know how to answer
The psychological consequences of almost dying and what he saw (remembered) on the threshold was so devastating that he absolutely felt cursed
In struggling to answer, he tracked down the origin of the word blessing
Sebastian is an atheist, but he feels that there are secular meanings to beautiful words like blessing or sacred
The origin of the word blessing comes from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning blood
The idea being that there is no blessing without a wounding, without a sacrifice
And maybe there’s no wounding without a blessing
And that battlefields are sacred because blood has been shed
Childbirth is sacred because blood has been shed
In pre-Christian Europe, often animals were sacrificed on holy days to bless fields, to bless buildings, to bless people
The twinning of blessing and wounding, they’re aspects of the same thing
“When I realized that, it allowed me to make an important psychological step where I stopped feeling cursed by too much knowledge”
That I’d somehow gotten too much knowledge on the threshold of death and couldn’t continue daily life with that knowledge
It was too burdensome, it was too scary, it was too true
And once I read the origin of the word blessing, I was like, “
Oh, I’m free.
”
It’s both; how wonderful
