Julia Wattacheril is a physician scientist and director of the Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. In this episode, Julia delves deep into the complex world of liver health, beginning with a foundational overview of liver physiology. She provides an in-depth look at how alcohol impacts liver function, breaking down the metabolism of ethanol and its detrimental effects. Julia then shifts the focus to understanding liver function tests and optimal enzyme levels, providing a detailed explanation of AST and ALT and elucidating why fluctuations in these levels may or may not be concerning. She provides a primer on the four major stages of liver disease, discussing risk and emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Julia highlights the role of liver disease in increasing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease and covers in detail the various strategies for diagnosing, treating, and preventing the progression of liver disease.

Julia’s training, the importance of liver health, and the challenges and innovations of hepatology [3:15]
Tell folks a little bit about your training, what it means to be a hepatologist and what led you there
Julia is a transplant hepatologist
Her clinical hat is divided into 50% liver transplant and 50% general liver care
How she got to that path ‒ she did medical school in Houston at the Baylor College of Medicine and completed residency there as well
A GI fellowship at Vanderbilt in Nashville
Then a transplant fellowship at Columbia
When it comes to her faculty time division, she tends to focus on
MASLD
(or NAFLD as it used to be called)
Metabolism and a nexus with endocrinology is also a big focus of hers
Give folks a sense of what the liver does
People have heard Peter say this before, but it’s worth repeating, “
The liver is this essential organ for which we don’t have extracorporeal support (that’s just a fancy word that means outside of body support).
”
If a person’s lungs don’t work, you have extracorporeal support
You have a ventilator that can do the job of the lung for a temporary period of time, hours, weeks, even months
Believe it or not, if the heart doesn’t work, we have extracorporeal support in terms of intra aortic balloon pumps or even ventricular assist devices
If the kidneys don’t work, we have extracorporeal support in the form of dialysis
Peter is not suggesting any of these things are a substitute for the real thing, but they’re remarkable bridges that save many lives
And yet we don’t have anything that even remotely resembles extracorporeal support for the liver
We have this essential organ and if it is injured, we don’t even have a way to bridge people to transplantation
Anything you want to say about that? Is that just a staggering feature of this organ?
It’s not for lack of trying
There have been some devices like the
MARS machine
that have been developed
The bulk of liver disease has historically been chronic, and so you have time for intervention
It’s the acute phases that we really need either a 3D printed liver or an accessory liver that could function either inside the body or outside of the body
Those efforts are being undertaken, but it both hearkens to the complexity of what the liver does and how hard it is to mimic when the liver is injured, what it can do
It also gives you a focus on the panoply of liver diseases, the timeline to development of liver disease, and the functional aspect of what it takes to actually get some of these devices to market
Peter’s story from his time at Hopkins
One of the attendings who had trained at one of the universities in Virginia told a story about when he was in his training: they were using baboons as a bridge to transplantation (not xenotransplantation)
They would literally put a baboon in a bed next to the human in acute liver failure
They would run conduits between them and obviously they had somehow
ABO
matched the baboon to the human, and they would basically circulate the human’s blood through the baboon using the baboon’s liver to detoxify and carry out
gluconeogenesis
(or whatever other features were critical in the acute moment)
Apparently, this somewhat worked
You could take a person who was completely jaundiced, on the verge of death and buy them another week or so until a liver transplant showed up
According to the story of this one attending, it worked really well until once a patient emerged from basically a state of unconsciousness due to their liver failure and realized what was going on and freaked out and panicked and pulled the cannulas out
It turned into a big bloody mess that ended with the baboon dying and the patient nearly dying, and that put an end to it
That story always stuck with Peter as the depths to which one had to go to try to basically save people during this period of acute liver failure while you either hoped for a recovery and/or found a transplant
Any of those stories ever come your way?
Not so much the animal portion
If you’ve read about
accessory livers
, you learn a lot about this from living donation: how much liver is required when people are in acute liver failure
It’s not something apart from the pediatric population that a small segment of liver could actually solve
For accessory livers, you’re implanting a human liver to basically function as a temporary means of metabolism and recovery of immune function and all the other functions that we’ll get to
But it’s much more on the human side than cannulas to a baboon, which is a good mimicker
We learned a lot about liver disease from alcohol in the baboon
This model was one that mimicked human responsiveness more so than other animal models
For example, nutrient deprivation that occurs from carbohydrate load from alcohol versus direct injury to the liver
The complex and crucial functionality of the liver, its four most essential functions, and more [8:45]
The liver is clearly complex enough that in the year 2024, we still do not have a way to approximate it the way we do most other vital organs
There’s something about it that’s obviously quite susceptible to injury in the modern environment
How would you get people to understand and appreciate the absolute beauty of this what Peter considers a very underappreciated organ?

Julia Wattacheril, M.D., M.P.H.
Julia Wattacheril earned her medical degree and completed her residency at Baylor College of Medicine. She completed a fellowship in gastroenterology at Vanderbilt University, where she also earned a Masters in Public Health. She completed a second fellowship in transplant hepatology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.
Dr. Wattacheril is an associate professor of medicine, physician scientist, and director of the Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Her clinical and translational work spans the multidisciplinary care of MASLD patients at all stages of their disease to the investigation of rare genetic variants influencing the development and progression of MASLD before and after liver transplantation. She currently leads an interdisciplinary research group using semi-automated techniques to identify at-risk and protected phenotypes within the electronic health record (EHR) for multi-omic analysis. Of particular interest for clinical outcomes discovered through EHR phenotyping include rapid progression to advanced liver disease, need for transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Her current projects test hypotheses at scale across populations. She has a particular commitment to develop and translate science and medicine not just across disciplines but to those most affected and often least included in the conversation. [
