Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find

Starting point is 00:00:44
of The Drive. I'm your host, Peter Tia. I guess this week is my friend Apollo Ono. For those of you who might not recognize Apollo, which I would guess is not many of you, Apollo Anton Ono is an eight time metalist in the Winter Olympics across three games, 2002, 2006, 2010, in short track, Speed Skating,
Starting point is 00:01:03
which is one of the most intense crazy sports to watch. We're going to have lots of videos of it in the show notes. And if that weren't enough, he also went on to win Dancing with the Stars, which sadly, we don't get into in this episode, though I wish we did, because we were talking about it over dinner. And it's simply another manifestation of the type of drive and determination that he brought to his sport. He brought to that show as well. He has a really unique upbringing. He was raised by a single dad.
Starting point is 00:01:33
And his father, who was an immigrant, played just an unbelievable role in his life through the good times and the bad. Which I know might sound like a bit of a cliche, but the level and the detail, which we go into it in this podcast, I think is quite inspiring. There's no question that, at least in my mind, that had a poll been raised by somebody other than his father. It's very hard to imagine he would have achieved the success that he has achieved. His father's role in his life has just been unbelievable. And I think that's a common theme we see in the people who are the greatest. One of the things that I didn't really fully appreciate prior to this podcast was how this entire nation of South Korea
Starting point is 00:02:10
basically grew to hate him in ways that are almost impossible to describe following a very controversial race in 2002. We go into that in great detail, so I'm not gonna go into the wise and the what's now, but the story is incredible both how he got to that point of being so despised by an entire nation and also how he basically went into the belly of the lion to confront this head on and ultimately the finish to that story is remarkable as how he got there. Apollo has been known even inside the circles of Olympic athletes as having kind of a surreal approach to training.
Starting point is 00:02:45
And we're going to link to some videos, including one that is my absolute favorite with some of his training routines, but his discipline, his work ethic, or legendary. Once that switch was clicked, you know, he spent the early part of his career basically riding on talent and then just realized, nope, I'm going to go all in on this. I never wanna finish a single race and have a single regret. Is determination character response to adversity? I mean, they're certainly inspirational to me. And frankly, I think this is of all the podcasts
Starting point is 00:03:15
I've ever recorded. If I was gonna say to my kids, I want you to listen to one, this is the one I want them to hear. At least of all the podcasts I've done so far, because this to me is really about grit. And I feel very strongly that that's arguably one of the, if not the most important, one of the most important things we want to be able to instill in our children is a sense of grit. So hopefully this will serve to give my kids a lesson on that and potentially for yours as well. The parallels between Apollo's life and Rocky Balboa are
Starting point is 00:03:46
just amazing to me and I can't resist making those comparisons a few times. And notwithstanding the fact that his name is also Apollo and of course Apollo Creed, though, spelt with two L's, is the fictional character that is one of the most important antagonists of Rocky Balboa that that's not lost on me. But if I were to sum up one Rockyism that sort of explains Apollo's life, it's the one where Rocky Balboa in the sixth installment of that movie series is explaining to his son that it ain't about how hard you hit.
Starting point is 00:04:18
It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. And obviously I love that as a metaphor for life. But I think it's illustrated here. Paul is just a great storyteller. And he's a beautiful speaker. And I think that's reflected in the fact that this interview goes on for almost four hours. It would have easily gone on for six or seven. Had we not already made commitments to do other things that evening. So I hope you find this interview half as interesting as I did
Starting point is 00:04:45
I think the show notes will have some really great stuff in them and there's gonna be links to some really cool videos that we Allude to including not just races, but some of the other stuff that goes Above and beyond that. Lastly, just a couple things on some housekeeping every Sunday I send out a weekly email that has been getting great feedback from the people who subscribe to it So if you don't subscribe to that, please do. If you end up thinking it sucks, you can always unsubscribe from it. Secondly, we've got a team of both Bob Kaplan and Travis Denson who do an incredible job putting together show notes.
Starting point is 00:05:16
Again, the feedback we get is there is no podcast out there that puts together show notes the way we do. It's basically a full-time job for one person, a part-time job for another person, and I believe that that shows in the volume of stuff that we're putting out there. So, if you're enjoying the podcast, at least take a look at the show notes, because you'll probably find something else that you might have missed or that becomes more clear. Lastly, if you are enjoying this, please head over to Apple Podcast Reviews. Give us a review if it's favorable. Great. If it's not, please at least be constructive
Starting point is 00:05:45
in your criticism so that we can figure out how to make this show even better. Without further delay, here is my guest today, Apollo. Oh. Hey, Apollo, thanks for coming down, man. Thanks for having me. Kind of funny that we're doing this now as opposed to what we were supposed to do.
Starting point is 00:06:01
We could give it. The original plan, the original plan, though, as I mentioned, is very memorable. I'll never forget it. The fact that we have a nice dinner, we're chatting, we're getting the rhythm. Okay, just follow me. We're going to shoot this place. It's right on the water. We're in Malibu.
Starting point is 00:06:16
It's perfect. It's very quiet. Guys, we have a problem. I don't have keys. I locked myself out. Yeah. The only saving grace is it could have been a lot worse if I'd killed myself or broken a bone, hopping that fence to crawl around the back of the house to try to get in. That would have been. No, you see, you see
Starting point is 00:06:35
pretty athletic. So I was like, oh, he's okay. If you were struggling over the first fence, I was like, okay, maybe I should give my hand, but it's, oh, he's got it. He's pretty good. Well, it was like, you held the light for me, it was awesome. Thank you. Yeah, now on lighting and grip. Yeah. I'm the main actor. I do the fence popping, I do the wall scaling,
Starting point is 00:06:54
but yeah, I need to see. Keepers of that, oh my guy, his lighting skills are just below average, bottom of the wrong. So by the way, all guests who come to my house, you had to have to drink Topo Chico. Is that your first Topo Chico? It was my first. It was nice. So by the way, like all guests who come to my house, you had to have to drink Topo Chico. Is that your first Topo Chico? It was my first. It was nice.
Starting point is 00:07:08
I love the glass bottle. I love the fact that you love it and you're so passionate. When you give it to me, it's like you're giving me keys to the house for the weekend. It's like, tell me how it is after you're finished. Well, I like the fact that only halfway through the first bottle, you asked for a second. So you've got that other one. It's nice. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:07:27
It's a strangely addictive quality. Yeah. When I first got into it, it was out of control. I was like, why am I drinking six of these a day? It's to become an expensive habit because they're hard to find. Well, man, there is so much I want to talk about. And I think we'll hopefully be able to get to much of it, though probably not all of it just by the nature of the depth will probably go into on some stuff.
Starting point is 00:07:45
But let's, for lack of a better planner's strategy, let's just go back to the beginning. So you grew up in the Pacific Northwest, yeah? I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. I was a very high energy kid, one who was mischievous because I think just had tons of energy. My father was working most of the time to provide so that we didn't struggle too much more than what we already did, which I didn't know at the time. And your dad, Grip in Japan, came to the US. Do you remember how old he was?
Starting point is 00:08:13
He said he was about 17 and a half years old when he came from Japan to, I think he landed actually in Oregon, originally. And he just started his life. He didn't speak a word of English. He didn't really know anything about the American culture other than what was kind of fed to him when he was in Japan. The only focal point he said that he had was that he just needed to get outside of the protocol like lifestyle.
Starting point is 00:08:36
That was existing within the Japanese culture. I think that to him meant going to the place that was a complete 180 and that was the United States. So he left on his own at 17 and a half. He left on his own against my grandmother and grandfather's wishes, who, which, you know, they wanted him to go to school, study, eventually work for a university and just kind of follow the same path that most, I think, Japanese follow, right? This is what you're supposed to do.
Starting point is 00:09:01
This is what you will do and this is what your life is going to be on a day-to-day basis. Something inside my dad just said, I don't want that. I don't want that type of future. And he came and he risked a lot. He didn't have any money. He just had, I think he had a camera in which he sold upon his arrival, and that's what he used to begin his life. So I can't even imagine how difficult that must have been.
Starting point is 00:09:22
Coming to the US, not speaking a word of English in a time where Japanese were not exactly the most accepted people in the country and then trying and he's to tell me that he was like, oh, I was a bartender. I was like, how could you possibly be a bartender? If you don't speak English, and my dad is really short too. So I can only imagine what that looks like. And also the grief that he probably got
Starting point is 00:09:44
from all the people who are ordering drinks that he would probably mess up. So he said that he like slammed his head against the door like many, many, many times to try to figure it out. And he did. Yeah, it's not exactly a forgiving crowd, right? Like six drinks in when someone gets their drinks screwed up, they're less likely to be empathetic to the guy struggling. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it was really challenging, but and then my dad, like weirdly, he said that he was studying,
Starting point is 00:10:09
I think he was setting a counting, and then someone asked, oh, he was walking by, like one of the classes was hosting like a hair cutting competition. And that's when my dad said, oh, that looks interesting, I could use some extra money, let me try that. So he ended the competition,
Starting point is 00:10:24
essentially like gotten like third place or something, like randomly, and then began his career to pursue being a hairstylest, which is really, really, if you knew my dad, it makes sense now, but even when I hear the story, it's just, it doesn't, nothing adds up. And he begins his life and he actually was, and started a pretty interesting career as a hairstylest. And more than a barber, I guess you could say. And we started in travel the world, had some success and he said that everything was changed, obviously, when I was born.
Starting point is 00:10:53
And upon my arrival, both my father and my mom, I think they were obviously going through some conflict of time. And so they divorced. My father took full custody of me and he didn't know how to raise a child. His only, how old was your dad? Do you remember when you were born? I don't know, because my dad's telling me he's been 35 since I was born.
Starting point is 00:11:14
So this is, yeah, which is kind of funny. That's a great anti-aging strategy. Yeah, yeah, and he looks great too. He looks not his age at all. So he, again, my dad, his only context for raising a son was the fact that people would come into a salon and that was his basis for conversation. As your barber or your hair stylist,
Starting point is 00:11:34
that's your personal psychologist if you've been seeing this person for 10 plus years. So as he's going through this process of raising me, he's basically getting all these women who come into a salon, like free parental guidance advice on a daily basis. And I think he started taking it. Because that is kind of unusual when a couple splits that the father would take soul control.
Starting point is 00:11:53
Do you know much about that in terms of, has your dad talked to you about? Because I remember, you know, I know you've told me before that you don't really have contact with your mom. I mean, you, in fact, you've never had contact with your mom since she left, right? Correct. Essentially, what my dad says is he is, I was the better suited to take care of you. And I also felt, even though I knew nothing about raising you,
Starting point is 00:12:14
I would do, and I had the ability to do what it takes to raise you properly. At least that's what I thought. And at least provide some form of kind of security blanket for my one and only child. And that's exactly what it did. And so it is interesting, I never met my mom,
Starting point is 00:12:30
even when I have a conversation like with my girlfriend, she's like, haven't you ever wanted to just meet her? And it's really strange when I say it, but I never think about it, right? So I grew up in a single parent household. Everyone in my neighborhood
Starting point is 00:12:43
pretty much was single parent household in some capacity, or they were raised by their grandmother grandfather. I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood household, everyone in my neighborhood pretty much was single parent household in some capacity or they were raised by their grandmother grandfather. I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood by any means, but that just was very normal where I grew up. And so to me, I never thought about it, right? And I never understood what that was like having two parents, but I didn't know. And so it might have had an excellent job obviously raising me, but there was never an inclination or a want to actually meet her. And I think as I get older, there is more questions of, I'd like to know from her perspective,
Starting point is 00:13:12
what happened. And I think we all have those kind of interesting thoughts and moments where we want to just divulge and just say, like, man, like I'd like to know my other half, right? My mom was adopted, which I found out much later. So her background in ethnicity is also somewhat mysterious, which is why my kind of fascination would try to understand my own genealogy and background in historical context.
Starting point is 00:13:35
Have you been able to dig into that through? Because the problem is if you're using stuff like ancestry, you have to sort of have enough information to put in the system. Yeah, yeah, exactly. This was maybe in 2006 or something, I think it was, maybe 2005. NBC was doing a show called,
Starting point is 00:13:52
who do you think you are? It might have been 2003, I don't remember, but I remember during that time, essentially what they would do is they would ask for your permission, they would then find out every single thing there is to know about one side of your family. So you say, okay, I wanna know about my father, or my mom.
Starting point is 00:14:06
And so I was really interested in my Japanese heritage. And so I had asked them to start really diving deep on my father's side. And then they, you know, they had traveled in Japan. They started talking to people in Japan. And for people who know, Japan is such a small but highly protective society, especially when it comes to personal records. And they essentially got zero information. highly protective society, especially when it comes to personal records. And they essentially got zero information.
Starting point is 00:14:28
And for whatever reason, so they're like, we know that you have probably some like samurai blood from this Yasunaga clan in your grandmother's side of the family, but that's really all we can get out of this thing. Wow. So I was like, kind of disappointed. But to go back, my relationship with my mom was, there was none. For all, you know, you could have half-subblings, of course. Your mom was presumably quite young when your parents split.
Starting point is 00:14:50
She could have very easily remarried. Yeah. And she still keeps in contact. I think it's been many years, but she was, at least until my very first in the big games in contact with my father and essentially said and called them after she had heard that I had won my first on the big gold medal. I'm very proud of him. I've been following him. She lives in the Pacific North West region. So she obviously saw my face on newspapers and on television leading up to the Olympic Games. So I think she felt very proud, but she did mention one thing to
Starting point is 00:15:18
my dad. She's like, I just, I feel this point in the life in both of our lives. I don't want to disrupt his path. And maybe when he's ready, he'll seek me out or something of that nature. And so that's kind of always been in the back of my head. I also have this weird, protective side of me because I have so much love and respect for my father in everything that he did. I don't want him to feel like he was less than if I go out and reach for my mom, right? And it's, and no, does it make sense? You would? No, I don't think so, but that was inside me for a long time. And so when you're raising a parent household, I think you're skewed in multiple ways. And they create little small micro traumas psychologically that maybe you don't recognize
Starting point is 00:15:57
when you're younger or you're missing some elements which makes you more dependent, maybe you're more alpha, maybe you're less, I don't know what that is. But for sure, it definitely, I was not the most equilibrium based athlete in the world. And I think a lot of athletes are like that, right? I think there's always something that happens early stage. And for me, it was always like, my father would always teach me that you can always be better, you can always be better, you can always be better. There's always another level to go to.
Starting point is 00:16:23
Perfection is seemingly unattainable, but that's your goal, and you don't stop until you get there. And that was so drilled into me psychologically from a young age. And it was never like, it wasn't super tiger dad, although thinking back, he did push me extensively. I didn't get that feeling when I was a kid, but it definitely taught me a lot about like my ultimate goal is to probably make him happy and have respect for what I'm doing and also I want to achieve that perfection and I never did I have had races where I would call it the perfect race, but now when I look back, I was far from it, right? But I think that psychology was started from my father and
Starting point is 00:17:05
watching him in his work ethic and you know, I was always athletic as a kid growing up in Seattle And I had been you know, I was a swimmer and I did track and field and I wanted to play football He said no, I wanted a box. He said no. I saw this crazy sport of short track speed skating and I was actually at the time I was swimming a lot and My father wanted me to go to Stanford or Michigan full ride. That was his goal, right? And we were getting these weird, like, conversational, actual snail male letters.
Starting point is 00:17:31
I remember back then, basically telling my father, if your son continues on this path of excellence in swimming, we would love to have a conversation about having him become accepted into this school. This was from Stanford. I forgot what yours. What was your stroke? It was breaststroke and backstroke.
Starting point is 00:17:46
Or my two. So I was 50 and a hundred meter breaststroke. Do you remember what your best hundred year breaststroke was? I remember. But I do remember my 50 meter backstroke, I broke like some 20 year state record at one time. And I remember because the guy who,
Starting point is 00:17:58
record who I broke at the time, he was still like, he was like, some of my coaching and my coach at the time, Bill Christensen brought me up there and he's like, oh, you know, this is the kid who broke your 20 year record and the guy's like, wow, you know, I have no idea what even, you know. What's interesting is, you know, usually backstrokers
Starting point is 00:18:15
don't make good breaststrokers in vice versa because backstroke and freestyle are long axis strokes, breaststroke and fly or short axis strokes. In your case, though, I can see, there's an interesting thing, which is, your case, though, I can see, there's an interesting thing, which is your legs are so freakishly strong, and those are the two leg driven sports.
Starting point is 00:18:32
So those are both what we would call rear wheel drive sports versus front wheel drive strokes. So it's interesting to think that you would be perfectly suited to do that, which means you would have been probably a really good IMR as well. Yeah, I was decent at my 100 meter item. I don't remember any of my times. Look, we're talking like when I was 12, 13 years old, right? So a lot can happen between that and college, but still, I mean, there was something there. I want to go back to something you said a
Starting point is 00:18:56
moment ago, right, which was at a very young age, your dad sort of instilled in you this, I don't want to put words in your mouth. I don't think you said it as the need to be perfect, but a quest for perfection. I talk about this a lot with my daughter, which is this idea of mastery, which is this process of trying to master something that you'll never actually master, because that's technically not feasible,
Starting point is 00:19:16
is the beauty, like that's the thing. And, you know, books that have been written about, it's usually written about athletes, but I think it can apply to musicians or any number of other fields. They talk about the common bond that seems inherent to many of these people who have achieved greatness, like you have, is this love of practice. Did you sense that early on? Did you enjoy the practice, or were you more task or goal oriented as far as the outcome. Early in my career, I would say that I wasn't, I didn't enjoy the process as much.
Starting point is 00:19:48
It was based on sheer talent. And this is I'm talking from the age of 14 until I was probably about 17. And you started skating at what, 13? I started skating, I actually started really, really skating at 12. I started really training at the age of 14. So you started swimming what?
Starting point is 00:20:05
Like is it five, six year old? But eight, swam locally and, you know, local competitions and state competitions. And then when I saw the sport short track speed skating in 1992 and then again in 1994, that's when I said, wow, this is an amazing sport. I used to inline in quad skate, like on the side at the nearby local skating rink.
Starting point is 00:20:23
I feel like I could do that. That seems pretty easy. It also looks ridiculous, right? These guys are wearing these. When you're like 11, 12 years old and you see these guys skate, it looks fake. And then when my father drove me north to Vancouver BC, I saw it live because of Canadians, they obviously loved winter sports. I was like, this is the most incredible sport I've ever seen in my life. It doesn't make sense how these human beings can be leaning over these impossible angles on a blade that's one millimeter thick and they're wearing outfits that resemble Superman without the cape. Like literally that's what they're doing and they just have helmets on. I was like this is perfect. I have to do this sport, right? Superman without the cape. Now that I
Starting point is 00:20:59
think about it, you know, we'll come back. It's a flying round this. I was going to say like, why don't they just have the capes on it? It would be so much cooler. Yeah, that'd be cool actually. Well, I wanna come back to the evolution, but let's pause for a moment and have you explain the difference between short track, long track, inline, all of these different types of skating. Sure, so inline skating is predominantly done outdoors, and they skate and they have competitions all around the world.
Starting point is 00:21:25
Now they have velodrome-like competitions, but it's in. So if you've ever seen a velodrome track for track cycling inside of that as a warm-up area, that's where inline speed skating competitions are being held in places like Bogota, Colombia, which is, by the way, Colombia is huge into inline skating. I don't know why or how, but it's been huge there. And so I, being growing up in the Pacific Northwest and having rain be a very big part of our culture, I did indoor skating.
Starting point is 00:21:54
So think of your imaginary roller rake and you have four pylons, right? One for each corner and you basically skate around. And you're on like a roller blade, but it's got how many wheels per the blade? I started out in quad skates, so two in the front, two in the back, right? And then it's just basically just speed skating.
Starting point is 00:22:09
So like if you've ever been to a roller rink growing up as an American, and it says, okay, it's time for speed skating and everyone goes out there and they play a song and we just skate around really fast and they finish, right? That's literally how I learned. And then someone in the local roller rink was, okay, you should try out for our club.
Starting point is 00:22:24
And I was like, okay, that looks, that seems fun. And my dad at that point was, this is like anything I can do to create more fatigue in this child, I'm in. I just wanna get him exhausted. Yeah, that is working nonstop. It's working all day long. He comes home, he's exhausted.
Starting point is 00:22:38
And I'm like this kid, it was just completely berserk at a control. Like I never get tired. I could just run and run and run, run, run, run, just unsatiable appetite for everything. Were you getting into trouble at all? Absolutely. Absolutely.
Starting point is 00:22:52
It was very mischievous, and the environment has a lot to do with that. But for whatever reason, I was, I excelled pretty early in some gifted programs when I was a child, and my dad was very much a proponent of pushing education and cram me down my throat and being like, look, take this test until you pass it, basically. How did your dad have the time to even oversee
Starting point is 00:23:13
how you were doing in school and overseeing your, you know, looking over your shoulder while you're trying to get your homework done, like how did your reflect back on what that even meant? I mean, I don't think he really could, right? I think he did what he could. I mean, I, most of my childhood was spent, my father was not there during the day.
Starting point is 00:23:32
So I would go to, go to school on my own, I would come back on my own and then until he came home and I can come back from school at 3 p.m. or something like that. Until 7, 8 p.m. Sometimes 9, 10 p.m. he's not there and I'm alone in the house. I had to cook for myself. And you're? 8, 9 years old. Yeah, very, 8 p.m. sometimes 9, 10 p.m. he's not there and I'm alone in the house. I had to cook for myself and you're myself eight nine years old. Yeah, very very young. So at a very early age
Starting point is 00:23:49
I was very independent on just relying on myself to kind of succeed. I didn't think anything of it at the time like a just lachky kid, right? And no idea. But I'd hate that word saying I'm like, yeah, that's pretty much what it was. You know, there's no way I can remember many many nights is like dark outside and I'm like, where's my dad? This is weird. But that was the reality. And thinking back, my dad, he put aside every single want he had in his life, everything. And it was all about me.
Starting point is 00:24:16
And for that, I feel obviously eternally grateful, but also I learned so much from such a selfless man. I get it. I'm his son, I'm the only son, I'm everything he has, everything he wants to do, he wants to see me succeed. I didn't recognize it when I was that young, I do now. So every waking moment was like,
Starting point is 00:24:35
how do I create more experiences for this child? How do I take my son to, we don't have a lot of money, so how do I take him to nature and experience things that are free, right? How do we go out and we can draw, we can create something in the sand, I can go and appreciate the ocean if that takes us a drive. I mean, we used to drive to all competitions, like we would drive from Seattle to Prince George Canada.
Starting point is 00:24:58
That's a far drive in the middle of winter, to go skate one day competition against Canadian kids who I don't know. I'm the only American there and my dad is basically driving for two days straight with no sleep, just so I can have that experience. When you're that young, you don't recognize how much of a sacrifice is an incredible, right? And then I think about now, I can't even do that now. I feel vibrant and peaking at this 36-year age. So I just have a tremendous amount of respect for my dad
Starting point is 00:25:26
in terms of his dedication, sacrifice, just because he's one of the best. And he didn't know what was good, what was bad. He just tried to do everything. So going back to the skating, so that's what in line is. And then talk about the different disciplines of skating on ice.
Starting point is 00:25:40
Yeah, so you've got their short track speed skating and then there's long track speed skating. And long track is the one that's been around forever. Like that's when we go back and see the Olympics 50 years ago. Correct. That was long track. Correct. So long track speed skating is what most people think of as predominantly being on an outdoor ice surface. That's a 400 meter oval. So imagine you just had a track and field track and you basically just you just if froze over during the winter and you poured ice and that's
Starting point is 00:26:05
your, and you use a zamboni, that's your track. Long track speed skating has the 500 meters. It has the 1000 meters, the 1500 meter, the 5000 and the 10,000. It's sort of parallel running. Yes, indistences. Yes, but you also in long track speed skating, it's all about time. So you've got your own lane, no one interferes with you, You know, you can have some moments where your pair, which you're skating with, is, you know, he's in front of you,
Starting point is 00:26:29
you can basically get a little bit of draft on the back end of a straightaway, but for the most part, it's you against the clock. And there's no hiding, right? You can't, like as soon as you stop skating, you kind of immediately start to slow down with the exception of like some gliding, but the most part, like time-trialing,
Starting point is 00:26:45
just like being on a bike, there's no hiding, there's no cheating. And when I first started, I actually started out how I started out doing long track as a proponent because that's what everyone does in Calgary and in other parts of Bute, Montana, I would skate. So that's long track speed skating. This skate itself used to be a fixed boot
Starting point is 00:27:03
and a fixed blade, meaning there's, imagine a shoe and then on your heel and then again on your- Kind of the ball your foot are these two cups that basically just, they just lock into the bottom of the shoe and then on the bottom that is the skate. And how long is the blade? The blade's about 17 to 18 inches long. And to get it's only about a millimeter thick, a little bit thinner than a short track blade. The actual bend and rocker of the skate is different.
Starting point is 00:27:31
But it's a relatively flat blade, correct? It's very flat. I used to play hockey growing up, but I was a goalie. And goalies have a much longer, flatter skate than the skaters. The skaters have a very rounded blade. And so, when you're goalie, you have all of this equipment on, so you're relatively slow. But in a straightaway, a goalie, even with all those equipment, can generally skate pretty fast, even relative to the regular skater, just because you have more blade on the ice. So I'm assuming, I don't know how many inches it is,
Starting point is 00:27:58
but it's obviously much shorter than what you're describing. So when you have what, 17, 18 inches of surface on that ice, that's a ton of contact, right? A ton of contact, but it's only in between the two cups at any moment, and even shorter actually of the time of which your blade is touching the ice. We can get into those kind of details differently, but that's long track speed skating. They then evolve to a clapscape,
Starting point is 00:28:20
which means that the rear heel of the blade was hand-touched. They attach it, yes. And it detaches, so that when you push, the blade actually still stays on the ice as a whole. That big heel comes off. So you get like a 5% to 15% additional advantage every single time you push. And I was, I watched that phenomenon come on. Come on, see. How much of an impact did that have on times?
Starting point is 00:28:39
It changed everything. It changed who was good. It changed who wasn't good. It changed which countries were really strong for a period of time because people couldn't understand how to skate in a clap skate mechanism because the technique is so much different. And it really became a lot to do with the type of equipment that you had and your ability as an athlete to transfer your power through the clap skate mechanism. You could be the world's greatest on a fixed skate mechanism, go to the CLABSCATE and not even make the top 20.
Starting point is 00:29:07
So it was a really difficult learning curve for a lot of athletes, and a lot of people started just to just basically give up and they just dropped out. Well, what year did that transition take place? This was 1995, when we really started to see it, 95, 96 and 97 was when that was the peak years of the CLABSCATE, what did you change. What drove that technological change? Was there some whispering that this is politically
Starting point is 00:29:29
motivated to change the power structure within the sport? Which countries prior to the 90s were the most dominant in long track? I would say with the exception of the Americans, right? It's always been the Europeans were always the best. A couple of Japanese, but for the most party was always the Europeans, meaning the Netherlands, some of the Germans and some of the Russians. Though Eric Hyden in 1980 has anyone ever matched that feat? No one has ever matched that feat. I don't think anyone ever will match that feat. And that feat again was he won five golds. He won the five-hundredthousand. He won all the distances in one Olympic games, which it would be like Usainte. No, no, it's it's yeah, there's no way to explain that.
Starting point is 00:30:11
I mean, it's the closest thing to that that I would say in recent times is Katie Ladecki winning the 200, the 400, the 800 in the Olympics. If there were a 1500, which there is in the world, but not in the Olympics, don't get me started on that. She would have won that as well. But you're right. I mean, it's sort of like a pre-fantane at one point holding the American record in everything from, I think, the 1500 to the 10K, then of course, to win the gold in all of those is.
Starting point is 00:30:39
And Eric was a specimen. He was a very special genetic human being. It is. Aside from that, his work ethic was astronomically high and he was a complete, this guy was a savage when it came to training. He would bury and still does, by the way, bury most people on a bike. And he doesn't train anymore. He's just, his ability to tolerate pain and threshold
Starting point is 00:31:06
and lack the acid is like when you watch a race horse and that race horse is obviously in pain, but doesn't slow down. It's very similar and when I was growing up, Eric Hyden was the king. And to be honest with you, he's to me, he's still the king and I tell him he's still the king because what he did was so ridiculously difficult. And my sport of short track speed skating, by the way, is very different than long track.
Starting point is 00:31:29
Yeah, I want to come to that, but before we leave Eric Hayden, I mean, one, I know we've talked a little bit about some of his training. I want to hear more about that later on, but my one connection to him is, of course, he went to med school at Stanford, which is where I went, and when I was in med school, you know, I used to ride my bike a lot. And there's this very famous hill near Stanford called Old La Honda, which is sort of the benchmark hill for cyclists. And anyone listening to this who rides a bicycle in the Bay Area knows Old La Honda. And not only knows it, knows their time up it because that is the metric, that is the equalizer.
Starting point is 00:32:00
It's about three and a half, three point six miles. It's got a number of switchbacks. It's relatively steep. I feel like it's almost 7% grade on average. And I believe the benchmark time is about 20 minutes. So if you're below 20 minutes, you're allowed to call yourself a cyclist. If you're taking more than 20 minutes,
Starting point is 00:32:17
you ride a bike. So it took me a while to break 20 minutes. My roommate in medical school, his name's Matt McCormick. He was about 17 minutes 20 seconds, which was exceptional. He was certainly the fastest of any of the people that I knew on a bike.
Starting point is 00:32:33
Eric Heiden apparently was about 14 and a half minutes up Old La Honda, which was and remains to my knowledge, the record up that hill. And I used to, I had a model that I built that would calculate how many watts you needed to average to go up that hill. And I used to, I had a model that I built that would calculate how many watts you needed to average to go up that hill. And I forgot, I don't think I've ever plugged Eric's time into it, but it wouldn't surprise me if that were a 600 watt effort given his body weight. He's a big guy. Eric Heidner's a very big and heavy, a quad dominant athlete. So,
Starting point is 00:33:02
I mean, I should go back and do that, but I think for someone Eric's weight to have gone up that in 14 and a half minutes, it's hard for me to imagine. He could have done that at less than 600 watts, which anybody who's ever stepped foot on any sort of hergometer knows that like anybody can hold 600 watts for 10 seconds. Most people can't do it for a minute. Very few people can hold 600 watts for a minute to hold it for 14 and half. That's so much power. And then of course he became a professional cyclist. Right. And I think he wrote a couple of tours. Yeah, yeah.
Starting point is 00:33:32
And he talked about it for 7-11 and he's he's an orthopedic surgeon now and I've never met him or know him at all. But it's hard for people who don't follow that sport myself included to really reflect on what it would mean to be the best in the world at such a broad range of distances because those are physiologically completely different events. I mean the 500 and the 10,000 have nothing in common really. They're completely different energy systems. They're different technique, different energy systems, different different. I didn't even realize that. So of course that makes sense, different technique, right? It's the difference between someone running 200 meters versus someone running 5K. There's different equipment involved.
Starting point is 00:34:09
I mean, there's so many things that it are so. And in the 80s, I think sport science was, especially in speed skating, was never a huge part of what we did. Like track and field and like cycling, which are, in my opinion, at the absolute pinnacle of pushing that, that red line, right, of utilizing science and what we understand of the sport.
Starting point is 00:34:32
Speed skating is a very unconventional, it's a uncomfortable position to be in. It's not natural to speed skate, being in that position, especially as a long track speed skater. So, you know, to train for that, what is, and still is, really, really excruciating. And there is no balance, right? We only turn left. So, you know, there's lots of imbalances aside from physical being. And, but Eric was a huge part of that motivation to train like an animal.
Starting point is 00:35:00
As was Lance and a lot of the other guys who at least I looked up to as being superhuman, not only for their accomplishments, but the way that they mentally attacked, pain and training, because that's where you win your actual wars in the training. Right. When you get to the competition, you can't do anything. So if you didn't show up ready, you can't hide that, you know, in my school. You can only lose it by showing up in the wrong headspace, but the right headspace won't win it if you haven't done the work. Your likelihood of doing very well is dramatically much higher if you prepare. And I think that goes with pretty much anything. So I was really interested in that psychology of what makes up someone like that. So I, you know, with Eric Heiden and many other athletes
Starting point is 00:35:45
who trained to the same tutelage of his original coaches. And I believe her name was Diana Holam. She was based in Milwaukee in the Madison region of the Midwest. And her training methods were very unconventional. And they were obscene. And they probably would be deemed very, you know, almost punishment.
Starting point is 00:36:05
They're on par with waterboarding today. It's like, yeah, like, not allowed to do that training. Yeah, like, Hey, Eric, here's what we're going to do since you're, you know, and by the way, like, we had a hundred athletes to start only 12 remain. That's our team. Now we start training together. So you can imagine because the other 88 got broken. Yeah, broken very early or they just didn't have the ability to recover based on pure genetics at this time. And that's how we train back then and watching and hearing these stories about Eric going up the Lake Placid ski hill with a large rope tied around him.
Starting point is 00:36:38
And that is tied to a tractor trailer truck tire, right? And he's just doing hill sprints up and down for like three hours. And he just did crazy stuff, like Rocky style training. And that mentality, like I mean, for me as an athlete, sport science is amazing, and I wish I concentrated more on it. But that psychology was what I was actually really, really, really interested in. That's what I loved.
Starting point is 00:37:04
I loved to do stuff that people thought was completely obscene and crazy. And, you know, like for me, like I would say 80% of my career, all my races were won ever before I got to the start line. The other competitors were racing for second. And they just knew that I was like just completely off my rocker. I was not in the same head space as them. I was different. I didn't talk to anybody,
Starting point is 00:37:26
I was, and I wanted to create that kind of bubble, right? And I got that from these kind of legends who I looked up to. There's a video that will definitely make sure we link to this. I have a feeling this podcast will have more links to videos than most of ours, but there's a video that I remember seeing.
Starting point is 00:37:41
There's like probably six, seven minutes long and it had some snippets or highlights of some of your training. And I actually was discussing it with Lance Armstrong once we were having dinner, and I was like, dude, you got to see this video of what Apollo was doing. And you were doing, I think single leg lateral jumps up two steps at a time. Yeah, yeah, most likely. I mean, Jesus Christ. I feel like I've done some crazy things in my day. I just don't think I have the explosiveness, single leg. That's the thing. Most people don't appreciate how much of a reduction you have in power
Starting point is 00:38:13
when you go from two to one leg. It's not half the power. You're losing way more than half when you take that second leg away. And then adding to it that you're doing it laterally. And I remember in the video, it says, yeah, this is basically a 48-minute set. and then adding to it that you're doing it laterally. Yeah, like it's... And I remember in the video, it says, yeah, this is basically a 48-minute set. Yeah, that was probably following like an eye session. Yes, it was.
Starting point is 00:38:31
I guess you have an eye session. That's where you do those. I mean, how often do someone get injured doing that? Because the thing that struck me is like, look, you can be the best stud in the world. You can have the toughest head in the world, but at some level, your ankle's gonna catch on that stare and you're gonna fall over a ladder.
Starting point is 00:38:46
Like you're always just one millimeter away from breaking your ankle. You're looking at me like, no, that would never happen. Yeah, never thought about that. Never thought about it. Definitely the risk was there. But then again, in short track speed skating, we skate together every day, sometimes twice a day for four to six hours a day, and we're inches from each other. And that blade is literally this close to my face.
Starting point is 00:39:10
Now, this blade gets this close to my face. It's just for reference. That's like, that's 12 inches from your face is where you're putting that blade. Every day, every crossover, every lap. Is that why you have such a smooth shave? Ha, ha, ha. The sport was very dangerous.
Starting point is 00:39:25
And I used to do really dumb stuff. Like we would have, at one point in the ISU, the International Skating Union implemented a rule that had to have, you had to have a neck guard to protect your neck and all major arteries on the body needed to be covered with a cut-proof material like Hevlar. And so everyone was wearing these cut-proof material inside of the skin suit. So it was basically sewn into the skin suit, the racing suit.
Starting point is 00:39:53
And I hated the feeling of the Kevlar because it didn't stretch. I used to cut mine out. So I would raise, it was completely legal, right? But I used to cut mine out and I used to race, we call it racing naked, right? So you'd race naked. So if I fall with another skater,
Starting point is 00:40:07
the likelihood of me getting caught is like 80%. And you're done, like that's one time you're done. But when you're young and you're dumb, I didn't many, many dumb things like that. But now they actually check before you get on the ice. You know, they see if you've altered the skin suit. So what year was short track a demonstration sport? Was it 92?
Starting point is 00:40:25
88 in Cali. 88, okay. And so what was the impetus for creating this new sport? You know, I'm not sure because the sport actually has been around for a long time. And people used to do short track speeds getting outdoor in New York City, I think in the 60s. I see. So it's just one of those things where the sport had been around forever and it was like, now we're just going to bring it to the Olympic level Yeah, and it was you go from long track speeds getting which is all about time
Starting point is 00:40:49
It's like imagine like you're watching a track and field race But no one can ever go outside their lane, you know We see that in a hundred meters, but imagine like a mile you can't move This is the lane you're given and there's only two people on the track of time and everyone is basically just that's time trials So that was like not that interesting to me and also I just liked the fact of racing was so much more, it was just more intimate, right? And it was psychologically a huge part of what I wanted to race against other athletes and outsmart
Starting point is 00:41:15
or outstratigize them. And I liked that moment of risk. And so short track speed skating is very different than long track speed skating. So you go from a 400 meter oval outdoor and long track is also indoor, but to a Olympic-sized hockey rank and the track is 111 meters around.
Starting point is 00:41:34
At the inside, at the tightest perimeter. Right, that's the actual track size. And you've got instead of just two people on the track at a time going for against the clock, you've got five to six, sometimes seven to eight skaters on the start line at once, all racing and jocking for position and drafting each other and passing on the inside and outside
Starting point is 00:41:53
and grabbing each other, bumping, making mistakes, and leaning over these angles because it's such a tightly held oval inside, our skates are set up differently. We don't have a clap skate, It's a fixed skate. We tried using clapscates in 1997 and 1998, but it just, it was, the sport is too dynamic and there's too much weight transfer from the, from the ball of the foot to the heel of the foot, where, you know, sometimes I would lean so far forward on the ball of my foot when I'm coming out of a corner. My heel would lift off using a clapscape. And so it was just very, very dangerous. You couldn't use that now.
Starting point is 00:42:25
I mean, Swarthruct Speed Skating is one that the blades are so offset. So imagine this is my skate. Instead of having the blade right in the middle, the blade is actually way over here on the left side, on both the left. Because you're always going left. Because you're always going left and you're leaning over so much at these angles that you need to have that additional Offset to make sure that you can you know still have enough pressure on that leg and also be able to maneuver it properly
Starting point is 00:42:52
So while I never even realized that in watching that that your blades were not symmetric on the bottom of the boot So I'm just straight They're actually even sometimes tilted depending on the what you like as a skater in your technical You as a skater have some say in that degree of tilt. You have all the say. So your control over your equipment is the one thing that is a huge part
Starting point is 00:43:11
of short track speed skating. That if you don't short track speed skate, which I'm assuming no one on this listen to the podcast does, it's such a huge part of the sport. It would be the difference between me feeling like I could never lose and me feeling like I'm not gonna make it into the quarter final. Like if my equipment feels that far off, it just feels
Starting point is 00:43:28
you just feel like you lost all your power. Maybe I can use another example. So imagine you're a boxer and you've got boxing gloves that weigh, you know, two pounds each. And then imagine the next time you put the boxing gloves on, then I'll 10 pounds each. That's what it feels like, how much different it feels like as an athlete when your equipment isn't is not dialed in or in the small things like the ice temperature, the grip of the ice, meaning like your perfect body weight and the amount of power that you typically generate in the corner. And they wet the ice, don't they, to give you guys more grip? Yeah, because the angles you're at are ridiculous.
Starting point is 00:44:01
We pour actually hot water in the corners of both sides of the track, and we're actually skating on top of the water. We're actually not digging in the ice. If you slowly down. So what's giving you the grip if you're not digging into the ice? You technically are, but most of the time you're on top of the water. So the grip is a combination of both the way that our blades are set. There's such a hardcore bend in the blade that when you lean over on that 1.1 millimeter piece of metal,
Starting point is 00:44:28
the blade will flex to a certain degree, and some of that bend comes out, and what's remaining is flexed position on a flat surface, from end to end, could you put like a dime underneath it? Does it have that much bend or curvature in it? Not a dime, but you can see it. So like, if I had my blade here, I should have brought my skate and I didn't put any pressure on the blade and I just laid it down. Later, yeah. The only ends of the blade will be touching.
Starting point is 00:45:00
The middle part, in between the two cups, which I mentioned, which was the ball and the heel. That whole area doesn't touch the ice until I put a lot of pressure. And then the ends no longer touch in the middle touches. So it's a, we bend our own skates, we rock our own skates. It's very, you know, it's very technical. We use a radius machine, which measures one one thousandth of a hair in between these two areas, which is about, I think it's about like four and a half inches across the blade and we mark it.
Starting point is 00:45:29
So you're born in what 80? 82. 82. So when you're 10 years old, this is a demonstration sport on the Olympics. So by the time you're 13, it's about ready to become a full-fledged Olympic sport. And it's sort of, it's in the crosshairs now for you, which is it's a sport that you're passionate about. Your dad's like, fine, let's let him do this
Starting point is 00:45:50
because it's better than him getting a concussion every day. When you started, I'm just guessing you were quite naturally talented to begin with because you alluded to it earlier that you didn't really start training until you were 14. So there was this year when you were just getting by on talent. Yeah, actually further than that. So, you know, from 12 to 14, my father took me around to small local speeds getting competitions, and I was winning most of them, even the ones internationally,
Starting point is 00:46:15
which I say internationally, mean just going to Canada. And I wasn't getting any competition in the States. I was getting all of my challenge from racing against other athletes inside Canada. And I had beaten pretty much anyone west of Toronto. And now it was a time where the only remaining place for me to compete in Canada was Montreal because that's where the real skaters came out of. I see, so it was Montreal, not Vancouver, that had the epicenter of skating.
Starting point is 00:46:42
Yes, and like Frederickton and a few of a few other places, Quebec City was a big producer of great Canadian short track speed skaters. There's something about Quebec. I grew up, I was really serious in martial arts and boxing. And yeah, like the national championships were always in Quebec or Ottawa, like some place close to Quebec. And the nationals was the only time you would face these guys. And they were like a different breed, man.
Starting point is 00:47:07
They're different breed. They were really, really tough dudes. Yeah, they're tough guys, yeah. And I had a lot of respect for them. The Canadian semi were always very, very strong in the sport and they still are today. You know, short track speed skating is not like cycling where you've got all these different athletes
Starting point is 00:47:24
from all these different countries all over the world. At the time, there was only a few really, really strong countries in short tracks, Beatsgating. The US was not one of them, by the way. So in 92 in the demonstration year, that's sort of the moment when it, I guess, presumably after 92 people say, well, okay, we're gonna take this sport seriously. Now the countries are deciding how much do we wanna invest in this in terms of our athletic programs?
Starting point is 00:47:49
Did the United States at that moment, did they do well enough in the demonstration games to decide let's put some resources into this? We did okay, we weren't definitely weren't dominant and we weren't on the podium. I mean, on the women's side, Kathy Turner had won a gold in 92 and again in 94. Other than that, there was no real funding mechanism. We were there, but at the time people were training in the
Starting point is 00:48:11
UP, they were training in Marquette, Michigan. Now, were you thinking, because now, but the time you get into the sport, it's 94, which means there was another Olympic year, because that was the, 94 was the year of summer and winter offset, if I recall, right? That was the whole Nancy Carrigan town you're harding year wasn't it? If I recall, that makes me feel old. Because I remember that like it was yesterday. Were you thinking, I want to go to the Olympics or were you just thinking, no, I just want to keep, you know, sort of beating whoever I'm skating against and I'm going to still be
Starting point is 00:48:37
a swimmer? I knew that I didn't want to swim. I see, okay. Yeah, it was around that time. Around that time you're kissing Stanford and Michigan, goodbye. I knew at that time that those were not in my path. Looking back, I'm very interesting. And I'm pretty sure I would have not gotten a full ride to Stanford if I had pursued.
Starting point is 00:48:54
And maybe I would have, but I, you know, obviously I didn't. So, you know, at the age of 14, I was winning quite a bit of competitions locally and domestically in the United States. And I was essentially being scouted by a few of these junior development program coaches who at the time the junior development program was in Lake Placid, New York. The same place where the 1980s and the games were, where Hyde and One has, you know, amazing five medals. And the miracle on ice from the US beat, the Soviets in the summer final. They went on and when the gold.
Starting point is 00:49:25
But that's where I was going to have to move to. And these coaches, Patrick went on the time, came to my father and said, we actually have a lot of interest in bringing your son early. You had to be 15 years old to be admitted into this program. I was only 14. And was this a summer-only program? Or was this an academy where you'd actually go to school? It's a real academy.
Starting point is 00:49:44
Like you actually literally moved there. You go to school there It's a real academy. Like you actually literally move there. You go to school there and you train to be hopefully the next stage would then go to the national team and train to go be a part of the Olympic program. Okay. I don't know what any of this stuff meant. Right? So they approached your dad. They approached my father.
Starting point is 00:49:57
They approached me. I wouldn't even know it. I was like, okay, that sounds not fun. You know, all the other side of the country, like I want to stay in Seattle. We've got, you know, very few sunshine days a year. It's the summertime, like, I don't want to go there. This was 1997, the summer of 1996. And they essentially said, you know, we want a polydocom
Starting point is 00:50:15
and what do you think? And my father was like, absolutely, I got to get this kid focused on something, you know, I kind of alluded before that I was pretty mischievous as a kid. I had difficulty concentrating and staying on task to one specific thing. Are you one of those kids that today would automatically get this label of attention deficit?
Starting point is 00:50:32
For sure. I'm sure I would have been loaded up on the regular and all day long. That are all kinds of stuff, right? So which my dad was always, he wouldn't care if I even got that diagnostic. He would never allow that. For some reason, my dad had been like 20 years ahead
Starting point is 00:50:45
of the game in terms of nutrition. I don't know where he learns this stuff, but anyway, a different topic. Well, he's got good lineage, right? I mean, if you just follow the Okinawa and you're pretty much gonna be okay. Yeah, yeah, the Centaurians. My father then approached me.
Starting point is 00:50:59
I remember this very clearly. He's like, look, you've got this incredible opportunity to train in Lake Placid, New York. You potentially could go on to be a part of the Olympic team, which would mean that you would mate the 1998 Olympic team in Nagano, Japan, and compete. Your grandfather's still alive. I'm from Japan.
Starting point is 00:51:16
This is your heritage. This is an incredible opportunity. Wait, was that a real possibility that it was... It was a real possibility. Because you would have only been 16, right? I would have only been 15. 15 in that for those Olympic games. Correct. I mean, for a men's sport to go to the Olympics at 15 is almost unheard of.
Starting point is 00:51:35
It's not unheard of for women, but for men, that's really. Yeah, that's amazing that they thought that that was a chance, right? Yeah. So that was that was the end. Like Michael Phelps went to his first Olympics at 15. What most people don't realize is he was fifth and the 200 fly was the only of any one for, which was still unbelievable.
Starting point is 00:51:52
It's hard to believe that a 15 year old boy could have gone to the Olympics and placed fifth in the world at arguably the second most grueling race in swimming if not the most grueling race in swimming, if not the most grueling race in swimming, he went on to break his first world record before his 16th birthday, if my memory serves me correctly, making him the youngest male athlete
Starting point is 00:52:14
to ever have a world record in a time sport. Yep. Michael's not human. I'm the Michael for years, he's not human. Doesn't matter what he says. And he trains, you know, monster, but he also is just not. He is put on earth to be in that water.
Starting point is 00:52:27
I think he told me one time, he's more comfortable in the water than my bed. It's more comfortable for me to be. I guess there's like a sense of weightlessness, right? Yeah, but that's amazing. Well, actually, you and Michael have something in common, which is you are both the most decorated Olympians in the United States in the summer and winter games. Michael, of course, also being the most decorated Olympian ever. But I don't think any U.S. Olympian is more decorated than the winter
Starting point is 00:52:48
games than you are there. It's arguable and subjective, right? I had an amazing career and I was very blessed to be and won that many medals, but I also had the opportunity to win a lot of medals, too, right? So, like, I grew up in the Olympian training center with these wrestlers. They only have a chance to win one medal. Right. Yeah, no, certain sports are amenable to any more medals. That title has been kind of tasked over and over again. And I smile when I hear it, because it's amazing, right? But I still look at Eric Hyden and Bonnie Blair, and they're very good friends of mine. And I still consider them to be like, you know, really on top of the podium. So, okay, so it's summer of 96. You're basically being brought in 18 months before what could be your
Starting point is 00:53:27
first Olympics. Correct. So it is it is the summer of 96 opportunity to move to be part of the junior development program. My father says you got to do this. I met a mischievous age. I didn't recognize my own talent. He says yes, I say no, he says red, I say black. Like, I'm always the complete opposite of what my father is saying. And so, you know, he essentially packs my bags, tries to explain to me the incredible importance
Starting point is 00:53:57
of what I'm about to embark upon. And then drives me to see Taket Airport, drops me off, waves goodbye, and then I wave goodbye. I had a plan in my head already what I was going to do next, and I walked right to the payphone, which we used payphones back then in 96. Put a quarter in it.
Starting point is 00:54:14
Yeah, exactly, and I called my friend, and I said I'm supposed to go to New York today, but I'm not, come pick me up from the airport. And then for the next, I would say eight days, I was bouncing around from like, no, like almost like 11 days actually, bouncing around from a house to a house all while my father believes that I'm still in,
Starting point is 00:54:32
like, plastic, but I'm so angry I never called him. And he hadn't got a call from the... What did the coaches do when you did show up? So the coaches called him eventually. I think this is probably like on day six or something like that, right? And they're like, hey, Mr. O'R picks me up. He's very angry, obviously, because essentially I was running away as a kid. And my dad just got this sense of wisdom and he's noticing these small little habits that I had been doing as a child that he really, really tried to train out of me. And he thought that by placing
Starting point is 00:55:16
me in this kind of single discipline sport of going in circles would do a lot psychologically from a beneficial perspective. I didn't know anything about that time. All I knew is I didn't wanna go there. Why do you think you didn't wanna go? I mean, you had been successful. Yeah. Do you think on some level you were afraid of going
Starting point is 00:55:34
and finding out you might not be as good as you thought you could be? I don't even think it was, I didn't even think I got that deep. I think it was just, I just didn't, I literally didn't wanna go. I wanted to hang out with my friends in the Seattle area. And it was that simple and also stupid
Starting point is 00:55:48
that I was gonna be throwing away potentially, because I could have very easily just said, no, I'm not gonna do this thing and done it again. And just never went to New York. And then we would never be sitting here talking about this. So, credit again, my father, who the second time he comes and takes him to the airport, gets on the plane.
Starting point is 00:56:04
And with the second time meaning, it's still the summer 96, it's just like a couple weeks later. It's like two weeks later. So first of all, I mean, that's pretty interesting that the coaches there didn't say, well, forget this kid, like he just failed the test, right? Like the test was, do you have the mental fortitude to even show up on day one? No, the coaches were like, we have to have this kid. He is, this kid is, he is going make US speeds getting, like, amazing. Those are not my words. These are things that are trying to tell my dad, which he tried to kind of tell him to me,
Starting point is 00:56:30
but, you know, when you're 14 and you don't agree with anything your father says, it doesn't make any sense. And so, again, this, just time he accompanies you there. Oh, he makes sure. So he flies to Albion, New York. We take the drive to Lake Placid,
Starting point is 00:56:43
he gets out of the car, he shakes Patrick Wellendland's hands. It's a good luck. And he walked around and goes home. And Patrick Wendland's like, oh shit. Like I get this Calvin and Hobbs character in my life. I don't need this kind of heat. But Patrick actually turned out to be an incredible coach
Starting point is 00:56:59
and mentor and guy. Do it at first night. I was just so awkward and weird. I mean, I'm a 14 year old kid. I'm living now in a dormitory. I've got roommates from parts of the country. I've never heard of or recognized. And they're all short track creators,
Starting point is 00:57:15
or it's short long steers. I mean, there's both. There's both. In the junior Olympic program, in the Lake Placidlemic Training Center, you've got Luz, you've got Bob Sled, you've got Cross Country, you've got the ski jumping guys, you've got Long and Short Track Speed skating,
Starting point is 00:57:29
you've got all the bi athletes, and you've got everyone there from the winter regions, because Lake Plaster's very cold in the winter. And so I'm a complete fish out of water. I look different, I talk different, I wear different types of clothes, I listen different types of music, I can't relate to anybody.
Starting point is 00:57:45
And I feel I hated it there the first seven days. I remember this very viscerally. I really, really every day would call my dad and be like, I hate it. This place is not for me. And my dad's like, just, you got to give it 30 days. You have to be there for a month. Just give it time, give it time. And prior to going, had you done much in the way of off-ice training?
Starting point is 00:58:06
Like you and I have talked, and we're going to talk later today about some of your legendary workouts in the weight room. Had you discovered that yet? Or were you mostly an on-ice guy and not doing a lot of dry land? I mean, my dad would take me, when I was an aqua, an inline skater, and my dad would wake me up really, really early in the morning before he went to work, and he would make me go to the park and skate. So the tiger dad or whatever you want to call him, that was very much, and I hated it, by the way, it was horrible.
Starting point is 00:58:33
I hated it so much, I told my dad I want to quit one time, because he was like, oh, you want to quit? Okay, tell me that you really, really want to quit. Okay, and for him, it was never about me actually becoming the best. I don't think that actually was ever part of his goal in life plan. His plan was to instill these mental strengths within me that never allowed me to quit what I was doing to develop the capacity to understand what it was like to truly leave no stones and turn during the preparation.
Starting point is 00:59:01
It's a very Japanese in his way, right? Like, okay, you want wanna do this one thing, then everything you do is dedicated towards being incredible. And, you know, like, think about this. The Japanese sushi masters, right? They have seven years before they're ever allowed to touch the fish.
Starting point is 00:59:18
They're just making rice every day. Dude, I would blow my brains out month two. Like, I could not deal with that, right? Like, you're telling me, I'm an amazing sushi chef. Like what happens if you're just really, really good and you're talented? Nope, you can't break the rules. It's gonna take you seven years of touching this rice
Starting point is 00:59:34
and making it perfect before you allowed to touch the fish. So like that kind of mentality of like this ever going method of trying to become perfect. And my dad left Japan, so he didn of trying to become perfect. And my dad left Japan, so he didn't want to do that, but I think he couldn't help himself. That's just a part of... Well, I mean, my guess is he realized that maybe at its most extreme end, it wasn't what was right for him, but I suspect he realized that there were elements of that that were
Starting point is 01:00:01
beautiful, that were important important and that he was succeeding as a result of, I suspect he wanted you to have some elements of that discipline and that again, passion might be overly simplistic, but the ability to stay on that thread and master something, which is interesting, right? Because look, I call parents, he wanted the best for you. At this point, you know, you're 14. Even maybe he couldn't have imagined you'd go on to be what you did. But it was like, look, this kid's going to go to college and whatever he's learning here, this grit will translate over to that next phase of his
Starting point is 01:00:33
life. And maybe he didn't really know when he had a master plan. I think he did. And I think he'll tell you that he did, but it wasn't exactly graft out. Like, you know, this is the recipe for having success and being a successful father, which I consider my father to be, but it was, it was, it was tough, right? I mean, you imagine, I'm really, really, really young. And I'm being forced at waking up at like six or five in the morning to go skate outside in a bit of a heart. Oh, that's right. You're, if I'm doing the math, right? You're 14. You're a year younger than the normal entry to this program, right? Yeah. Yeah. That started. And when we, when we arrived in Lake Placid and
Starting point is 01:01:08
I was going through the process of understanding like if I even like the sport like I'm probably like a week number two or three I sort of recognized like wow, this is I feel a lot of freedom here. I don't my dad's not here The only kind of authority figure I have is my coach who is really, really easy, but also I respect because he's figured out a way to talk to me in a way that speaks to me. Is he kind of your first real coach? He's my first real coach. So all of the previous year and a half or two years, you were, it's my dad who obviously, you know, despite his greatness, doesn't really know much about speed skating. You know, there's nothing about speed skating. So you're sort of like, you're just going out to the track and just, you know, despite his greatness doesn't really know much about speed skating. You know, there's nothing about speed skating.
Starting point is 01:01:45
So you're sort of like, you're just going out to the track and just, you don't have a strategy. You're just trying to win. Yeah, I mean, every time I would skip back then it was cheerly based on talent. Nothing more. I didn't train. In other words, off the line,
Starting point is 01:01:58
you're going for broke every time. You're not trying to be tactical and outsmart somebody necessarily. Yeah, basically. And, you know, arguably I was just better than most of those kids. They didn't, in my eyes, they didn't know how to speed skate very well. So now you got this coach and presumably he's looking at you being like, we've got to break some habits here.
Starting point is 01:02:14
Yeah, so we do the body composition test first and I'm like obviously the highest. My nickname was chunky as a kid. And, you know, I was eating everything in sight with a cafeteria. Wait, wait, just let's put this in perspective. There is no way you were at chunky kids. I was junky. What was your what was your body fat on that first test? I don't remember the body fat, but it was the highest and there was some chubby kids in my in our program. There were some chubby kids. I mean look I'm 14 years old though. I don't know how how lean there. I was going to be coming out
Starting point is 01:02:41
and looking like you know how shredded but I was the highest by far. Did you always kind of have that physique of just having huge enormous quads and enormous foods? But I was just a thicker kid, and partially because I just was eating everything and I was going to puberty and everything was tasty and I was just eating it. I had no understanding, any capacity of nutrition
Starting point is 01:03:01
and that what it meant. Right, which is so funny knowing you now, right? You're so dialed on everything. Yeah, try to be much more specific in terms of how you live your life. And anyway, but back then, it also didn't really matter thinking back. So I get these tests back and I'm deeply embarrassed
Starting point is 01:03:18
to be the most chubby kid out there. And I remember the coach telling me one time, like, what do you want to do? Like, what are your goals for this year? I don't know, like, goals. What does that even, what do you mean? My goal is this year. I couldn't even think about the next six months, let alone the world team trials in eight months from now.
Starting point is 01:03:36
Like, I had no idea what that meant. And then so, I started to understand that I actually liked speed skating. I liked being out there on the ice. I liked the feeling. And I remember one time, I, because I was so embarrassed by that first test. The first time I went back to just one sort of technical issue about the sport.
Starting point is 01:03:50
Short track has how many distances. It's the 500, the thousand. 500,000 and 1500 meters. 1500. And then we have a relay. And across those three distances, had you exhibited proficiency equally or were you more geared towards one or the other?
Starting point is 01:04:03
At that age, I was stronger in the 1500 meters. Okay. I was more, I would say, we would call it an endurance athlete. So two and a half minutes on the ice at a time, separated by 20 minute breaks and then, you know, you race basically every 20 minutes. Jesus, that is Phelpsian. Yeah, it's like that's the races, I think, in the Olympics where Michael would have, what, 17 minutes between a heat and a final or something, which it just seems impossible to imagine.
Starting point is 01:04:28
Yeah, your recovery has to be very, very high. And that's why most athletes in short track speed skating, even to this day, they train for all the distances. They train for the 500, which is the pure sprint, 40 seconds. They train for the 1500 meters, which is two and a half minutes, and they even train for the 3000 meters, which is only held at the World Championships, which is like, you know, 4 and a half minutes. And he even trained for the 3,000 meters, which is only held at the World Championships, which is like, you know, four and a half minutes. So going back to my story,
Starting point is 01:04:50
I was so embarrassed by this body composition test that I sat down with Patrick Wentons and I asked him, is it possible that I can become too good too early? And he's looking at me, I remember looking at me like, what the hell is this kid talking about? No, that's why you're here, right?
Starting point is 01:05:06
And he's like, no, and I was like, what happens if you burn out? And he's like, he only burn out if you don't like the sport anymore if we train you too hard. Like, and it's not going to be the latter. So as long as you continue to like this, you're going to be, you're going to do great.
Starting point is 01:05:18
You just, you got to focus. And that began my kind of understanding of if I really concentrate on this and I really care about the outcome, I was able to achieve really, really interesting results. And I went to the Junior Trials, which means you make the Junior World team. And I was supposed to make that team, and I didn't. I got third. So it's like swimming where the top two make it. Correct. Okay. And I remember going back home and being so pissed that I didn't make that team that I just started actually really attacking the weight room.
Starting point is 01:05:48
Was that kind of your first big loss? Was that the first time you were surprised at an outcome? It was the first time that in short track speed skating that I was supposed to make a team but I didn't. And I just remember that feeling. It was so itchy. It's like the itch that you can't scratch and it's there every day, every second of the hour. Do you remember that race? What happened?
Starting point is 01:06:07
You race had multiple different distances, but it just, it was a combination of, I wasn't good enough and I wasn't racing properly. I shouldn't have made that team. So you sort of reached your limit of natural talent? At that age, yep. And that was a time where if I wanted to make significant changes, it had to really concentrate both technically and also on the physiology of training to be a short track athlete. And I started attacking the weight room. And that was the only way that I knew how to exert like this, you know, I'm this, I'm
Starting point is 01:06:34
going through pre-cuberty as a kid. I've got all this testosterone. I'm genetically gifted for the sport. I just have to put it to work. And so that was the one major difference as. I just remembered to basically putting more plates on the squat rack at the age of 14. And it was very easy. And I noticed like, I remember like a week would go by,
Starting point is 01:06:52
and my like strength would increase by like 30%. Like it was like just compounding. Boom, boom, every single week I was just getting stronger and stronger, stronger. And when I arrived in the world team trials in 96, to make the 1997 world team. I ended up actually winning the competition, which in for, you know, the viewers who don't understand that's like a, I was 14 years old,
Starting point is 01:07:14
racing against guys who were grown men. This is a junior world. This is to make the team to go to the world to represent the US. This is an again, for most people who don't follow Olympic sports outside of Olympic years, you sort of have an Olympics three out of four years because you've got Olympics or worlds. You actually compete every single year, exactly. So we've got World Cup, we've got World Championships,
Starting point is 01:07:35
and that's what we're doing every single year. We're not working at Home Depot and just having fun. So you made the team for, this is 97. I need to go to the world. So this is the team, this is now means you're an odds on favorite to go to the Olympics in 98. Absolutely. I mean, I dominated those trials.
Starting point is 01:07:53
What did you do at the worlds that year? I think I got 19th in the world, I think. And I remember that I had never skated against the Chinese or the Korean. I only skated against Canadians and Americans at the time. So you hadn't even skated against Europeans. I skated against no one other than those two countries. And you know, when you talk about Canadians, I probably skated against really only like 10 guys from Canada who were semi-competitive with me. So when I went to the world championships, the first thing I noticed was the track pattern in which these athletes were skating were so vastly
Starting point is 01:08:22
different. And that's when this light bulb came my head and I was like, oh my God, the US is so far behind. We are skating the wrong way. Everyone is basically, when they exit the corner, they're hugging the, you know, the blocks and they're basically creating the smallest distance possible to protect their inside lane in position. And I was way out by the boards. So you're taking a faster turn, but going a greater distance.
Starting point is 01:08:45
Right, you're basically creating more pressure on your legs, but you're being more protect. So it's also, I didn't notice the strategy was so much more important in international competitions. And I felt like we were skating two different races. And, you know, I performed pretty poorly because it was my first world championships, but that's when I saw like, this is the big leagues.
Starting point is 01:09:02
These are the guys who are really training to win medals. These are the Koreans, these are the Chinese, these are the Canadians, these are the real national teams. This is all they care about. This is all they do on a day-to-day basis. And it was a huge difference between racing domestically at the world trials level in the US versus international. Once you actually go.
Starting point is 01:09:21
And that's when I was like, wow, I have to, if I want to remain competitive, like, it felt so, I felt so far away at that time. Were you discouraged? I mean, it sounds like a silly question to be 19th, but did you actually expect to go there and win? Or did you expect to do better than 19? No, I didn't have any expectations to be honest with you. I didn't know what to expect. What I didn't understand was, you know, again, this is 97, so this is pre-Elympic year, which means we were having the world championships in Nagano, Japan, because they usually want to have a test event
Starting point is 01:09:50
to make sure the venue works properly. So you can imagine all of the Japanese that are there, right? My father's there, my grandparents are there. I mean, it's a full arena with 20,000 people in that arena. I'm 14 years old, I've never skated in front of more than like 1,000 people in my life, let'm 14 years old. I've never skated in front of more than like a thousand people in my life. Let alone this many people. And I just remember the roar was so deafening and I just was like, man, this is this is this feeling is so addictive and
Starting point is 01:10:15
looking at like all the other athletes and their like colorful skin suits and the Koreans and they skated so differently than we did. The Chinese had their own style of skating, the Canadians, the Italians. And I was like, man, this is crazy. Like, this is, I can't believe what I'm here. And I finished that competition. I very much realized and recognized that the Koreans, in my view, were significantly better than everyone else. Technically, the way they raced, the way they carried
Starting point is 01:10:41
themselves on and off the ice was very, very unique at the time. And, you know, I came home from those world championships with an incredible experience. I mean, mentally and psychologically. And then unfortunately, instead of spending, this is now 97 this summer. So I'm going into trials for the Olympics are going to be in February of 98. So I come home in March of 97. So you've got basically eight months till the trials? So I've got three and a half to four months until I go back into the national team program. Now, before I was in the junior team program,
Starting point is 01:11:14
training late-classed, we now, I would be relocated to Colorado Springs, the official Olympic training center of the United States. And this is where all of the guys who I just beaten, you know, a month before, this is where everyone's going to be housed and trained. 80% of the guys who I just beaten, you know, a month before, this is where everyone's gonna be housed and trained. 80% of the guys, some guys had their own personal coaches in Saratoga Springs and other areas,
Starting point is 01:11:32
but most of the team was training in one location. And, you know, if you have 12 people there, only five are selected to the team. One is an alternate for skate the relay, the top two from each distance skate individually at the games with an opportunity to win a medal. None of this makes any sense to me. Still, okay?
Starting point is 01:11:50
Even though I had just won, and even though I had done very, very well, I come back from that competition and I go back to Seattle instead of training, my food choices were like basically Taco Bell, pizza, and zero, zero athletic activity. I'm talking. I'm talking. I don't think that I truly understood the importance of the off-ice training mechanism and off-season training.
Starting point is 01:12:14
I thought this was the break that you're supposed to take. And my dad's like, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be working out. I was like, no, whatever, I just, you know, tell him I did. And I didn't. And I fell back into the same negative habit of hanging out the same kind of crowd and individuals who,
Starting point is 01:12:29
that's what my dad wanted me to get away from. And now that I was doing it, I'm getting older, I'm more crafty, I've got experiences in my belt, and I'm just doing it on my own. And finally, when I get back to Colorado Springs, you know, and you head back at the end of the summer, they're beginning of the summer now. This is the end of the summer.
Starting point is 01:12:46
End of the summer, 98. So you're like four months from trials. More, like maybe like five and a half months from trials. And so now I'm in a position where I've gained like all this, I think I gained like 20 pounds or something crazy from when they saw me the last time. You can imagine, I'm still going through puberty, I'm still kind of maturing, zero training, eating complete garbage food, and my physique totally changed. I just show up with like basically there's two spare tires around my body.
Starting point is 01:13:10
And I remember hearing when we're doing body composition, we all take our shirts off and do this test. I remember something that athletes going, holy shit, like what the hell has that kid been doing? You know, everyone's been busting their ass in the off season because they all recognize the importance. And I just remember being called a spring and it was a different environment. I didn't have Patrick wetlands in my head coach
Starting point is 01:13:33
at a different coach at the time. Because Patrick stayed with the junior team? No, Patrick was the assistant coach on the national team. He had zero power or say in the training. Just the way the structure was working at the time, and I wasn't mentally committed to the sport at that time. And that's not a good thing, right?
Starting point is 01:13:50
So here I am now training with the national team, huge importance. Everyone's trying hard. Everyone's committing everything they're doing. And I just going through the motions during that year. I just, do you have a sense with the benefit of hindsight as to what, what else might have been going on in your head at that time? Because you've now tasted success, right? And not only have you tasted success, you've tasted success on the back of huge effort,
Starting point is 01:14:11
right? You had already discovered the weight room, you had discovered your capacity for work, which like, felps and like, heightened and like, all these other great athletes. It's really the capacity for training that seems to differentiate them. You figured out you had that. You figured out your superpower and then you decided, yeah, I'm not going to do it. It's like this self sabotage, I think, that early in my career, and I actually, I struggle with this later on in my career too, as an athlete, where it's going so well. It's almost too perfect. It's too easy. It's going so well, it's almost too perfect. It's too easy.
Starting point is 01:14:45
Let me throw a little monkey wrench in here and really, let's see if I don't train and if I can really make the team again. Because let's see if I'm really that good. Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying. Psychologically, I had a pattern I think of doing that. What's the minimum effective dose of training I can get to still, you know?
Starting point is 01:15:02
Yeah, let me basically like screw off and like almost throw this opportunity totally away and see if I can get to still, you know. Yeah, let me basically like screw off and like almost do this opportunity totally away and see if I can still come back and get it. And remind me, because I'll come back to that and the way that I raced for many, many years also is exactly like that. Let me wait until the very, very last lap to make a move. I don't have that's a very dangerous.
Starting point is 01:15:18
Like you're talking about it has to be perfect. You can't. Yeah, the margins gone. Yeah, you mean, so you're playing with fire at that point, right? And I remember one time skating a race, a great Canadian speed skater, Mark Gagel, he watched me do this. I got to wait until the last half lap that I passed all four skaters on the outside. And he's like, oh, you're playing with fire, man. You're going to get burned one day, you know? I remember that like in my head because I did, and it did burn me. So anyway, so, I mean, just to go back to your question,
Starting point is 01:15:46
yeah, that's what happened. I mean, I've been blessed enough, I was blessed to have a really unique gift to athletics and specifically in short track speed skating. And I was really squandering. It was so easy, it was too easy. I couldn't recognize that you've got this talent. You really also have to really, really dedicate yourself.
Starting point is 01:16:05
And don't throw away this incredible opportunity because there's a thousand guys in line who have half a talent that would do 10 times more work just to be a fraction of what you could possibly become. I didn't recognize it, it was just so stupid. And I kick myself now thinking about that, but that's what happened. So the whole year that year in Colorado Springs,
Starting point is 01:16:23
I went, I just going through the motions, very defined against my coach. Didn't really want to be there. So when you entered the trials in December of 98, did you think you were going to make the team? No, I wrote it off. I said, I don't even want to make the team. So you don't want to be here. I'm completely self sabotaged at this point. I am so far departed. I'm the say, I have the same mentality as I did before I went to Lake Placid. And so when I go to these trials, and we do a time trial in the beginning, let's say there's a hundred people showed for the trials, you do a nine lap time trial, and from those results,
Starting point is 01:16:56
only 16 are now racing. And that's the bracket. 16 people now is making up your preliminary quarter, you use a bank final. I finished a year. don't say 17th. I finished 16th. You made it. No, no, I didn't make the team. I made the content.
Starting point is 01:17:11
You made the content. You made the content to go, yeah. But I got last. So basically, I should have got 17. I mean, we wouldn't have to skate the whole competition. Right, right, right. I end up skating the whole competition. So you now earn the right to complete the right.
Starting point is 01:17:22
I earn the right to try to compete. And we still have video video tape to this. Every race I'm just crossing the line with my head facing the ice and looking down and just completely defeated as 15-year-old. And so my father, this to me, is a really important part of my life. My father sees this.
Starting point is 01:17:39
And he had been spending all his time in Seattle, right? So my father sees this. He then takes me from Boston with a time. So he takes me back to Seattle. After the meet, you've lost. You didn't make the team. I mean, everyone was just, I hear the quiet conversations,
Starting point is 01:17:53
oh my God, this kid, he's just, he's another student in this team. He threw it away. He has so much talent. Oh my God, my dad's embarrassed, right? He's like, oh my God, like, what the hell happened? Like, you were number one less than a year ago ago you were supposed to go and be a medalist. I mean I already bought tickets for
Starting point is 01:18:09
the Olympic Games like he'd already set aside time to spend there so now we're in a spot where my dad is like look you have to make a decision do you want to continue in this path of Olympic you know pursuit or do you want to do something else and I'm like I don't know what I want to do he goes well that's exactly what I'm talking about you don't or do you want to do something else? And I was like, I don't know, I don't know what I want to do. He goes, well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You don't know what you want to do. So he takes me to this place where we used to go to and have vacations, which is three and a half hours southwest of Seattle. Eric called Moclips Beach, which is sounds nice,
Starting point is 01:18:36
but it's like rains like, you know, 300 days a year. And it's like very dark and it's beautiful now, but he drops me off. And he says, you're going to stay here until you figure out what you want to do with your life. I mean, stay there. You're going to stay here in this cabin because either you rented a cabin and you're going to stay here until you're ready to the real answer with what you're going to do. And I don't care what the answer is, but you have to come to a real decision and commit yourself.
Starting point is 01:19:00
And that's what you're going to do. And he leaves. This is like the best parenting story in the history of parenting. The bad kid, right? The only tough love is the only way to do this. And he drops me off and he says, this is what you gotta do. And I have food and I didn't have,
Starting point is 01:19:14
I mean, there's no video games. Yeah, exactly. You don't have a cell phone and iPad. That's where I'm at. No, there's nothing. It's just me and nature. And I have like workout gear. I have a stationary bike.
Starting point is 01:19:24
Like I have my old bike and I set up a little spinner in the back and that's it. And like a pen and pad to make notes and journal. And every day, I'm like 15. 15. And you know, again, if you go back, like I grew up kind of taking care of myself. So it's not a big deal to me,
Starting point is 01:19:40
but I mean, thinking back, I'm like, oh my God, that's a pretty serious thing. What do you think? Have you ever talked to your dad about what was going through his mind on the three and a half hour drive back to Seattle when he dropped you off? He was terrified and scared and afraid. He's making the wrong decision.
Starting point is 01:19:53
He's a bad parent, is this too much? Am I going to be able to handle it? And I think my dad is like, this is nothing else is working. No one can get to this kid. He's got all the green lights in his life and he's throwing him away. Like, this is it. This is the last straw.
Starting point is 01:20:11
This is the last effort. With the guy that didn't have, Jocco will link down the street to basically say, did really drill home the importance of what it needs to be done. I can call Jocco right now if you want. And I would love it. I have that. Now. I can call Jocco right now if you want. And I would love it.
Starting point is 01:20:28
Now, I would have invited him over for dinner, because I never even thought of it. So just thinking back, I was so fractured mentally. Did that first night in that cabin hurt more than that first night, your dad yanked you back to like, placid? No, those would be two tough nights, right? It was different because this time, when I left the Olympic trials in 98, I actually knew that I could have made the team.
Starting point is 01:20:50
And here's the sick part. I think that if I trained just for one month before, I probably would have been top three and I would have made the team. Had I just put, like, a fraction of effort and I didn't want to do it. I know for sure, I wanted to taste such devastating defeat when I'm supposed to win something. I think I was addicted to that self sabotage of, okay, I'm at the real bottom now. What do I got to do? And so I spent nine days in this cabin alone, riding down, making a journal. I still have the notes, actually. I'm riding down my thoughts and making a journal, I still have the notes, actually. I'm writing down my thoughts and praying
Starting point is 01:21:25
and trying to just determine like, why am I here? What am I supposed to do? Give me a sign. I was like mindlessly going out on these runs, 45 minutes, an hour, half an hour, and it's raining every single day, by the way, because this is December and it's cold.
Starting point is 01:21:42
And like, there's no, by the way, there's no one there. This is like the place where they send people who are part of the witness protection programs the way, there's no one there. This is the place where they send people who are part of the witness protection programs. There's literally, there's a Native American reservation, 15 miles up the road, and other than that, there's literally no one else staying at these cabins. So it's you and someone from the Gambino crime family and witness protection.
Starting point is 01:21:59
As a 15 year old, it's not fun. I mean, now I would love to spend time there alone and solve this thing. Yeah, I was gonna say, think of the address. I need to go. I mean it's it's a place where I go when I need to make really really But I consider to be important decisions. So I want to make a shift you still go I haven't been in a couple years But I'm I'm planning taking actually my girlfriend pretty soon. It's a beautiful place is there's nature is I think really It's always been a very important part of my life. I think my dad did that when I was really you know where the exact cabin was
Starting point is 01:22:24
The exact cabin I know exactly they rebuilt it right so it exact cabin was? I know the exact cabin, I know the exact place. They rebuilt it, right? So it's much nice. Someone bought the, it was called the Iron Springs Resort at the time. And back then it was, it was. Iron and Springs generally don't go side by side. Right, right.
Starting point is 01:22:38
It wasn't nice. And definitely, they should have left off the word resort. For sure. At the time, I felt like iron springs jail, pen and ten tree. Every road is basically like a one way road and you're surrounded by these beautiful trees, but again, I'm just running every day and mindless.
Starting point is 01:22:53
I'm just trying to figure it out. 15 years old, I'm at the fork in the road, what I wanna do? Do I wanna please my dad? Does my dad want me to speed skate? Does he want me to do this? And then finally, I was like, you know what? I think I want a speed skate. I think I, does he want me to do this?" And then finally I was like, you know what, I think I want a speed skate.
Starting point is 01:23:06
I think I want to actually truly dedicate myself to do this. And also, I was pretty bitter that I didn't make the team, which doesn't make any sense, right? Because you had it in yourself. You had it in a true way, yeah. But I was also like, I hated the feeling of that, of like the opportunity was there and I didn't take it.
Starting point is 01:23:24
Were you still in touch with your friends that you had grown up with that obviously for the year and a half prior you'd been somewhat detached from because you're now living this separate life training? But what did your friends think of this opportunity? I mean, did a lot of them think? They didn't know. They didn't understand what you were going through. No, I didn't really talk about it.
Starting point is 01:23:40
They didn't really understand and that was very much in my own head. It was when I made the decision to continue one more time and really, really give short tracks beats getting a try, that changed my whole life. What do you think happened in that nine days that made you, because you had to leave there, go back home, watch the Olympics six weeks later, basically watch three other skaters in your flag and your colors that thought, you know, I really could have been one of those guys and then decide, I mean, not that you would have known it at the time, but this would go on to occupy your life for the next 12 years, right? Yeah, so I remember calling my father and saying,
Starting point is 01:24:25
I made a decision, I want to come back to Seattle and he didn't ask me what the decision was, by the way. He just came and picked me up and drove me back and during that three and a half hour drive, I explained him what I want to do. And he's, I can feel that he's like, okay, let's see. And so I go back to like, placid to train under a different coach. You wait till the Olympics are over, I assume? No, this is still during the Olympics. I go back to like, placid to train under a different coach. You wait till the Olympics are over.
Starting point is 01:24:45
No, no, no. This is, this is still during the Olympics. I go, I go the right away because after the Olympics, there's a world team trials, which the, the format's messed up. But so after the Olympics is a world team trials, now I have the opportunity of, of making the world team, which at this time, you know, after the Olympics, no one's training, no one cares about the world team. And I remember just kind of training really hard
Starting point is 01:25:06
and studying and I get sixth at those world team trials. So I was a double alternate, which means I would skate no distances at all, but I would basically just carry the bags for everybody. And if two guys got hurt, then I had a chance at getting in. So I went to those world championships and I just had a different view. My something had switched in my mind. And I started taking notes, and I made promises to myself,
Starting point is 01:25:28
like real legitimate promises that I could never get out of. When I get home, I'm not calling anybody. No one's even going to know that I'm back home in Seattle, and my off season, or the time spent after this, the next 4-5 months, is going to be completely dedicated towards just being a monster. And so, I set up at State Standard Bike in the basement, had a half months is gonna be completely dedicated towards just being a monster. And so set up at State Standard Bike in the basement, had a small seven inch or nine inch Sony Trenton TV,
Starting point is 01:25:50
VCR, and I just watched skating tapes every single day, trained twice a day alone, until I arrived back in Colorado Springs as a part of the national team program, and I was significantly more fit and stronger than anyone else, and developed such a strong aerobic base that I was
Starting point is 01:26:05
bearing everyone on my team even though I was still ranked number six I was by far number one. And so the next big test for you would have been the 99 Worlds. Yep. Which was where that year? Sophia Bulgaria. The real test was actually that year 98 I won my first World Cup medal and I'm winning a gold in the thousand meters against the reigning thousand meter Olympic champion, Kim Dong-sung, and Fabio Carta, who was like, many times you should have won World Champion, and I won. I came out of nowhere.
Starting point is 01:26:35
That became my real first taste of winning on the World Circuit, and again, this is post Olympic gear, so it's not that important. People don't really care. No one in the US has even been watching this stuff. It really cared to me. It also was a time where I got in, I started to work with a sports psychologist
Starting point is 01:26:52
and that was the big, big difference in terms of performance. What did he or she teach you? Or what was the most important insight that you got early on from that experience? So this guy named David Creswell, who was pretty young at the time. I think he was actually still studying.
Starting point is 01:27:06
And he was going to... How did you meet him? He was brought in as an intern to basically look over a lot of the younger athletes. And he also was doing a sports psychology kind of residency program at the Olympic training center. And so he was so pro about, you know, all these different things. And he started asking me, we would play Babmonton, like for fun. I would make mistakes like over and over again. And he would notice me, we would play Babmonton like for fun. I would make mistakes like over and over again.
Starting point is 01:27:27
And he would notice that I was kind of getting down on myself. And he would ask me if he's like little questions. Like, oh, what happened there when that shot, you know? And I, this guy was so young, I was like, I can't respect this guy. And I just, I didn't recognize the time. He was basically trying to figure my, how I ticked.
Starting point is 01:27:41
Like what made me angry and the inconsistencies that would happen on the court were a direct representation of actually what was happening in sport. And so that was my first real foray and to understanding. And so we did everything from like, you know, meditation exercises to breathing exercises to writing down positive self, you know, the basics, right, positive self-talk, manifesting what you want. And then he began my real true process of visualization. And then I ended up winning the 99 Junior World at that time in Montreal, which was a huge win.
Starting point is 01:28:11
The time you were still eligible to compete at Junior World. I was still eligible, 16. And it was hugely beneficial. The mental component of the sport was always to me the most fascinating and the most underutilized in every aspect. And to my detriment later on in my career too, always to me the most fascinating and the most underutilized in every aspect.
Starting point is 01:28:25
And to my detriment later on in my career too, because I did things that completely are very destructive when we look at things about it in terms of sports science and the training that we did. But to me, I didn't care. Like I wanted the edge of being able to say, I'm going to wear this 45 pound weight vest. I'm going to go up this man to incline five times back to back and do skating jumps every 25 steps on one leg and then switch to the left and then do them alternating boom boom boom and just do that back to back until basically I throw up. Now there's no physiological benefit you're getting after like the first set, right?
Starting point is 01:28:56
But the psychological advantage that you would create is just this mental hardness that no one else would do. And I loved it. The harder it snowed outside, the less people that are outside, I want to be out there with the weight vest doing some dumb training. That to me was the epitome of what was a driving force later on in my career. And I craved it time and time again. You mentioned it earlier, and I know you've talked about in the past, that you always looked
Starting point is 01:29:19
at boxers as role models, even though you didn't end up boxing. And it's funny because that's very much a boxers mentality, right? I mean, I think with every sport so much of it is going on between the ears, especially a sport when it's against another individual, which is not to take away from the team sport. But when you lose in tennis, there's no subtlety about who won and who lost, right? But this idea of how the training feeds the beast, you know, growing up, I felt it's so funny. I mean, on a much smaller level, I remember, I used to run at 430 every morning. So all of high school, I would run at 430 and it had to be somewhere
Starting point is 01:29:55
between five and 13 miles was the distance. And growing up in Toronto, it was so cold in the winter that like the colder it was and the darker it was the happier I felt, because I remember thinking like the guy I'm going to fight is not up at this moment. There is no, he is in a warm bed. And that just that fact absent any physiologic benefit became the thing that you needed to hang on to. And again, I don't know how many skaters thought that way, but you clearly were training like a fighter.
Starting point is 01:30:23
And living in the in the Colorado Springs Olympic Training Center, we were all rooming with different short track athletes. And then there was one time in which instead of rooming with a short track athlete, they had asked me if I wanted to room with a wrestler. And every one of the time was like, no, the wrestlers are dirty. These guys always get staff infections. They're like just nasty. Then they're crazy.
Starting point is 01:30:43
And I was like, sure, I don't mind, like I'll run with the wrestler. And that was my first entrance into the mind of a fighter. And I loved it. Because I'm like, look, I wear spandex for a living in skating circles. It's not the most manly thing known to me on this planet. But I wanted it to be more than it was. Because that is primal. I mean, you could argue wrestling or coax correcting or about as primal as any sport gets.
Starting point is 01:31:07
Right. You're fighting against another human being, basically. And in my own right, I was fighting in my own ways, right? And there's many correlations there. But I love the psychology of those wrestlers that I would see and I would go in the sauna post weight training workout. And I would, I was the only non-restaurant in the sauna every time they were in there, ever. And I just remembered like talking to these guys
Starting point is 01:31:29
and hearing them talk to each other and watching them cut weight and be like, these guys are not human. They are doing everything against what I was told from a sports science perspective. And they still are winning. Like that mental toughness and fortitude, that's what I craved was that old school rocky mentality
Starting point is 01:31:46
and that hardness that is created that I loved. And I thought that was the only way that I could beat the Koreans. That was the only, because I didn't skate as beautiful as they did. And even to this day, I still love it, right? I still like that mentality. And it was a huge part of my career
Starting point is 01:32:01
was developing that mental fortitude and that strength and that consistency of being so obsessive and Replace my self-sabotage stuff with the self-sabotage came in the form of like let's just do some workout that makes no sense Yeah, you went the pendulum swung so far You stopped self-sabotaging and incompetence and in effort and you started to overdo it and Again, I even just some of the videos I've watched, I'm like, oh my God, like I watch it now as an old guy
Starting point is 01:32:30
who's only thinking about how to avoid injury. And I'm like, oh my God, like all the ways you could have just destroyed your body with those things. Yeah, we used to do some really just ridiculous training, but you know, again, you're young, your body's resilient, you're gifted, you're doing what you love. You're in arena where that's the only thing that matters.
Starting point is 01:32:50
Nothing else exists outside of this realm of short track speeds, getting it's the most important thing in the world. Nothing else is here. It was beautiful and I loved it. And so 2002 is the big test now. You've had four years to get on the horse. You've won some meets, some important meets, but for most Olympic athletes,
Starting point is 01:33:12
the world only considers the Olympics. They don't care about winning the worlds, even though the competition is just a stiff at the worlds. So going into the trials in late 01, were you nervous? What was your confidence level going into make the 2002 team? I was nervous at all. I was ready and I skated incredibly fast there.
Starting point is 01:33:33
I did a time trial. I was like 123.8. Was my time trial time? Wait, wait, that's your 1500 time. That was my 1000 meter time trial time. And at the time, no one was skating under 125 in the world. So when the world heard that I had skated this lap time, they knew no one was skating under 125 in the world. So when the world heard that I had skated this lap time, they knew that I was ready. And you know, the Koreans,
Starting point is 01:33:51
the first time they had to worry about an American skater who was in their race. It was the first time a Canadian had to worry about me was, you know, kind of through 1998, 99,000. So it's interesting that time trial is kind of a nice normalizing metric because it strips out the technique, the strategy, the where this person is. So just because you have the fastest time trial doesn't at all mean you could win. You may still get, you may have a dumb race, you may not be able to maneuver and sort of physically get in and around to their skaters. But it's certainly a beautiful metric.
Starting point is 01:34:18
It's a brawler. Yeah, yeah. It's sort of like encycling. It's your FTP. Yep. It's your functional threshold power. Yep. And it shows like, oh, this guy is an incredible shape. By the way, what is your lactate at the end of a thousand meter time trial?
Starting point is 01:34:31
How high would your lactate get? I don't even remember. My lactate was low. You're like Lance Armstrong in that regard where Lance is lactate after the typical set that they would do, which would be a one kilometer uphill sprint, and they would do lactate checks at the end of these. I mean, his lactate levels were just half of everybody else's. Yeah, I was very low. So a lot of the sprinters had super high lactate levels. They were like about 20s or something crazy. And I was like always like nine or something weird. I forget the actual numbers, but we would do six by 1,000 meters. With what rest?
Starting point is 01:35:01
I want to say the rest was two minutes. So it's two minute rest or on an interval that gave you about Two minute rest from however you've got to nine laps again fast Jesus. Yeah, we hated doing lactate testing But that was so they would prick you each time each time. Yeah, yeah, so that generates your lactate performance curve Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and mine was pretty steady like I would maintain like my lap time and also my Speed was around the same even in the set 456. Wow. In speeds getting a lot of it got to do with technique. So yeah, although it's so funny, like I don't know what they're doing these days in sports
Starting point is 01:35:33
science because I don't really pay much attention, but I wonder if they're doing muscle biopsies on people and looking at lactate clearance and stuff like that. No. No. No one's offering up a little vast is lateralis biopsy. I and maybe they are in cycling, but I can tell you from just the same to your podcast, 99.99% of all athletes in the US who are Olympic level have no idea what they're doing when it comes to
Starting point is 01:35:58
nutrition, when it comes to training, they're just doing what kind of they're told. And I say that with all due respect, right? But that's just that's just a lot more impressive that they can do so much with it. And it's changing slowly, but since I retired in 2010 and being so obsessed with like looking back at my career
Starting point is 01:36:14
and wondering how different I would have done it now versus then and just understanding how that human body works and all the different efficiencies that, or deficiencies or overt over training and recovery, and there was so much, I think, specifically for short track speed skating, because we were so predominantly dominated by the Korean culture and skating, they never used sport science. They did everything by eye, very old school, right? They were just technically the most proficient and the most beautiful.
Starting point is 01:36:41
Biomechanics were, and if you did study their training and you did study the way that they skated, it all made sense. But they, again, they didn't you, they didn't have a sports science team, they're measuring lactate. When I went to my first Olympic Games in 2002, like the rumor to the Korean team was that I had like some unknown military NASA grade technology that I was using because I couldn't figure it out, right, because I didn't skate that nice.
Starting point is 01:37:06
With O2 Salt Lake City. Salt Lake City. Yeah. Post 9-11, it was an incredible experience. It was incredible being 19 years old. Your first metal was it a gold or a silver? My first metal was a silver. Was it the thousand?
Starting point is 01:37:20
It was a thousand meters. Oh my gosh, which is, that's the funniest race of them all. I didn't know that was your first metal race. That was my first Olympic final. It was a thousand meters. Oh my god, which is that's the funniest race of them all. I Didn't know that was your first metal race Olympic final Can we talk about like how funny the race isn't funny, but the video we're gonna link to is exceptional, right? It's perfect. It's actually perfect. I'm so happy that I can laugh at it now I Feel like so honored that I could have shown you that video because you hadn't seen that in the video
Starting point is 01:37:46
until I showed it to you. No, but it's so perfect and so many levels. It's like watching your face watch it for the first time. I can't believe I couldn't have had that on film. There was just genuine joy. Like you couldn't stop laughing at that. Which is, I'm sure that would have not been that funny at the time. So let's tell people about that race, right?
Starting point is 01:38:09
So you're pretty fave for going into this race. It's you, there's a Chinese skater. Yeah, to give you context, I was in the cover of Sports Illustrated, and I think that the article was about, this was February of the games. It's pretty amazing to put a speed skater on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
Starting point is 01:38:25
It was ridiculous. And, you know, a sponge by Nike and I was going to these games and they said like a poll has the chance to win four medals, four golds going into these games. And everyone in short track speed skates like that's not gonna happen. No one's that dominant. Our sports suvolta and variable, it's just impossible.
Starting point is 01:38:41
Yeah, which is true, right? I mean, this is a much heart and not to take anything away from long track, but in long track, you only have to worry about yourself. Right. It's you against a clock, as you said, in short track, anything can go wrong. Yeah. Almost without exception seems to go wrong.
Starting point is 01:38:55
It always goes wrong. Yeah, whatever plan you had never goes exactly. My favorite Mike Tyson line, right? I don't know if Tyson actually said it, but it's like, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. It's exactly what happens, too. Everyone's technique is beautiful until you start to get tired. Yeah, or until some guy jumps right in front of you and grabs you.
Starting point is 01:39:13
Or pushes you, or you get bombed, or someone time trials it from the start. Now your whole plan from the beginning is completely out the door. You're not prepared for that. So, here we are, 1,000 meters. I'm in the final. I've got one of the best Canadian skaters, Matute Akad. I've got a Chinese legend, Lee Jajun.
Starting point is 01:39:31
I've got this young kid, Anhyun Su, who's 16 years old. He looks like Harry Potter with glasses. Literally, that's our nickname for him is Harry Potter, who skates so technically beautiful that I'll get back to that later, but first I'll talk about it. And then we've got Stephen Bradbury. The Australian.
Starting point is 01:39:47
The Australian. And by the way, let's tell us after. So the race begins, I have my strategy. But Bradbury had called you before, right? Didn't Bradbury have some connection to the skate company? Two days before the semi-final, and he says, hey man, hey mate, that's a high-imed Stephen Bradbury
Starting point is 01:40:02
was working for the skate manufacturer that made my skates. And I think they were in Brisbane. He says, like, hey, I know you're probably gonna get on the podium, would you mind giving a shot out for the boot company, RBC, revolutionary boot company? And I'm like, oh, Stephen, no problem, buddy. You know, the problem is, good to see you, you know, and he was like, oh, so he's like the typical Australian.
Starting point is 01:40:20
I loved him. But I never thought this guy would make it past a preliminary round. I didn't know, actually, I didn't even think about it. I didn't even know he was skating the Olympics. Like that's how much non, like he wasn't even there in my mind. He was just another person who happened to be on the ice. Like he could have been replacing the blocks on the ice, right? He wasn't even a competitor. Yeah, you're thinking, why are you wearing spandex just to replace the blocks? Like you could do that in much looser fitting clothing.
Starting point is 01:40:45
Yeah, I'm gonna say that jokingly. And then the day the race is, he, this miraculous thing happens where two people get to squalify and fall down. He makes it into semi-final, and then he makes it into the final. Like he doesn't make it. He makes it because people fall down and get to squalify. And now he is like sitting here in this final with like,
Starting point is 01:41:03
any, by the way the Canadian the Chinese the Korean and me anyone you can win gold anyone on the skin when gold I feel very very confident my ability to win gold and I had a very specific strategy. Two and a half laps ago I start my my outside past I blast off one lap to go I noticed that the Chinese skater is starting to set up a pass or at least put himself in position to pass me I didn didn't want that to have happened. So I started skating very defensively and protecting my outside and inside position. Thus slowing us down. We fight. The Chinese skater falls down about a half lap to go. I swing a little bit wide. The Korean skater tries to go on the inside of me. He falls down into me. I fall
Starting point is 01:41:41
down and we all take out the last guy who's matched you to a caught who's in third place. The Canadian. The Canadian. Chinese goes down, the Korean takes me and then we all take out the Canadian. So everyone falls down the same corner, to this day has never happened.
Starting point is 01:41:56
Which is the last corner. The last corner. I can see the finish line. I'm in first place, by the way, so I feel like I'm going to win. And I remember thinking my head, I'm going to win. I remember thinking that. And then literally as soon as I snap my fingers, it was like the karmic reaction. You're spinning out of, like you're down and spinning. I'm spinning. I hit the wall. I'm gonna know what happens. I later find out that like my right skate through my back hitting
Starting point is 01:42:19
the boards, my right skate comes inward and actually stabs my left leg. And that's where I have a small cut on that left leg. I get up, I throw my skates across the line. And when I didn't know at the time that Stephen Bradbury, who was like over a half a lap behind when we all fell down, it only takes about eight seconds to get around the track, comes around and he finishes first and I end up finishing second. And the video, which, I mean, we're gonna link to the video of the race because I remember the first thing I thought when I saw that was I was actually impressed that you had the presence of mind to get up and get across the line because it looked and I'm not a skater so I can't speak to it but just as an observer,
Starting point is 01:43:00
it looked so disorienting when you went down. It was. That I was like, geez, I wouldn't even think to do anything other than just stand up. I wouldn't, and it's not like it wouldn't take me two seconds to realize to get across the line, but you didn't have two seconds. It had to be like a brainstem activity. There could be no cerebral involvement. It had to be pure brainstem of, I'm down, I'm spinning, I'm cut, get across the line.
Starting point is 01:43:25
And you did what none of the other skaters were able to do. You were the first one in that whole melee to get across the line, but of course, Steven got across first. It's giving you the silver medal. Yeah, and I ended up winning the silver. And it was, it was a really good shout out for the boot company because the first and second guy, both got, we're wearing the same boot. That's right.
Starting point is 01:43:46
And Steven, I remember, you know, he just kind of goes across the line. It raises one on him. He barely, he's standing straight upright across the line. He can't believe it. It's the least, like, impressive thing. And Bravery cannot believe what just happened. And no Australian was watching the Winter Olympics, by the way. So all of a sudden, they got a surprise, send someone there from their media team. They're like, oh my god, you got to get off the surfing
Starting point is 01:44:09
track and get over on me. Right, right, right. So he, Steven wins. I ended up actually winning Silver very disoriented. I had no idea what just happened and got to cut in the process. And it was the most important race of my entire little bit career because at the time, look, I very much wanted to win. Not only that, it was so important for me, I felt like I should have won. I think that's natural for me to say that, right? I really felt like I should have won
Starting point is 01:44:35
and I felt like Steven should not have won. I didn't know actually that he won at that time. I couldn't believe what just happened and I was trying to figure out my head and process. So meaning after you've crossed the line, it's still not entirely clear that he's won. Even though you've seen him also skate across the line sort of bolt up right, but you haven't figured this out. Yeah, I mean, I knew that someone crossed the line and it was probably Stephen, but more importantly, I was figuring out like, what just happened? Right. If there are a rule that says like, you can't come from 200 feet behind when everyone, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah they had a chance to like, oh my gosh, like that was a crazy, crazy race.
Starting point is 01:45:27
And I remember coming out and someone asking me, what, Paul, what does it feel like to lose the gold? That was the first question. It was the first question. My guy was like, I didn't lose the gold. I won the silver, you know? And that answer wasn't entirely me. There was a guy Brent Hamilo,
Starting point is 01:45:41
who was our sports physician at the time, came in the locker room because he had to look at my cut before we went back out there to go receive our medals. And he was like, hey, man, I know you wanted to win, but that was incredible. You have to be so proud of yourself for having that ability to cross the line. It was so instinctive, right? I would be an idiot to claim that I had that plan. It was all my grandmaster idea to do that, but it wasn't.
Starting point is 01:46:06
I just, I feel like I had to finish the race. Dude, it's another boxing analogy, right? We can't get away from the fact that your name is Apollo. Okay. And in the second Rocky, when Rocky and Apollo fight, they both go down. This is a very rare occurrence in boxing that both fighters go down.
Starting point is 01:46:21
And if they both can't get up, it's a draw. But if one of them can get up and the other guy can't, he's the winner. And obviously, everybody knows how that goes. Rocky amazingly managed to get up while Apollo couldn't. So this time Apollo actually got up first. Yep. Got up first, but I finished second and goes my first Olympic games.
Starting point is 01:46:40
I felt like I had been through a lot psychologically. Even though, you know, you have to race again that night. Two days later. Okay. Oh, this is something I should tell you. Before I went out there, I had been through a lot psychologically even though you have to race again that night two days later Okay, oh this is something I should tell you before I went out there. I had to get stitched up quickly Guess who my surgeon was Eric hide and come on. Yes Eric hide and so Eric hide and stitches me up And I was like looking at him. He's like, hey man. That was an amazing like that was so incredible and All I want to tell was like Eric. I'm just trying to be like you. I'm just trying to win every distance. Right. Cause like, you know, like I still, even though it was pretty impossible, that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to win. I wanted to sweep just like Eric
Starting point is 01:47:12
Heiden did. And I feel like I had the ability to, if everything went my direction. And this was the first blemish. But it was pretty cool to be able to be stitched up by kind of like your idol. And then have that conversation and then have him say like, hey, look, your Olympics aren't over yet. Like, you're just getting started. So get back into the game, remain your focus and forget about this race as much as you can and prepare for the next one. And then we're not there. Happy as hell. 19 year old kid from Seattle could have thrown it all away.
Starting point is 01:47:40
And here I was competing in my first Olympic Games, post-9-11, hearing thousands of Americans screaming USA, chanting my name, I would never replace that with anything ever in my life. It was so, it was awesome. I felt so proud to be able to win a medal for the US and win a medal for my family and for my team and for my country. How long after the race did you get to talk to your dad?
Starting point is 01:48:09
Immediately, because NBC grabbed him and they wanted him right down by the ice and right away. What was his reaction? He was just proud. Was he worried about your leg? I mean, what else was going on in his mind? He was worried about my leg. He was right by the ringside and he's,
Starting point is 01:48:23
my father was looking in. I see my dad right away. He's just, he's just very proud, you know, and that to me, it felt very, very good. And I remember standing on the podium, even though not hearing my, you know, my own national anthem being played, just feeling amazing. And actually thinking back, if there was any person in that race who I would want to win the gold versus me, it would probably would have been Stephen Brebery. And just because that guy and people don't know this, he had been through hell.
Starting point is 01:48:47
Like a skate blade had gone through that guy's leg at one point, like he had almost died many times on the ice, like pools and pools of blood. He had come back from devastating injuries, broke his back, like weird crazy stuff, and threw it all, he stuck with the sport. And he was the last man standing. He wasn't the best speed skater. He wasn't the most technically gifted. Physically, he stuck with the sport. And he was the last man standing. He wasn't the best speed skater.
Starting point is 01:49:06
He wasn't the most technically gifted physically. He was a monster, but he wasn't supposed to win that race, but because he didn't give up, he ended up winning that race. When everyone else was better than him, everyone else was there, and it was pretty remarkable. So. Matt Target, who's a swimmer, an Australian swimmer,
Starting point is 01:49:22
he's been to, I think, three Olympics. He's a good friend of mine. And I actually sent him the video that we're going to also link to because that's the one we were talking about earlier, which is the, there's an Australian guy who does a commentary and voice over dubs the video. And it's really funny. His point being is like, if you just stay out of people's way, you can still win, right? And I think he said to me that in Australia, there's still an expression around his name.
Starting point is 01:49:44
Like, you can pull a bribery, all right? Yeah, you win the lottery. Oh, you just pull the bribery. Oh my God, you know, like, you just, you jumped out of a plane, your parachute didn't, didn't open and then somehow someone else grabbed you, did a bribery, like just freak golden horse you luck. By the way, Stephen Brebori retired that night.
Starting point is 01:49:59
Every when the gold. He knew it was an amazing, yeah, he's like, this is the pinnacle. This is the pinnacle. I am now on and I have an Australian stamp with my face on it. This doesn't get better than this for me. Australia's first winter Olympic gold medal.
Starting point is 01:50:13
So you had to go on and continue through these games. So how did the rest of those games go? My next race was the 1500 meters in which I was battling against my rival at the time, which was two guys Mark Ganyong from Canada, and also Kim Dong-Song from South Korea, who was the reigning Olympic champion in that distance. And Kim Dong-Song had this very specific strategy, which he had been testing on me throughout the entire year.
Starting point is 01:50:36
And that was he was going to lead the race with about seven laps to go and just do a negative split. So every lap get a little bit faster, a little bit faster, a little bit faster, and skate very defensively. And my strategy was known all over the world that I always waited until the last two laps. Because your explosiveness, you just basically based on your lactate tolerance and your explosiveness,
Starting point is 01:50:57
you're gonna outmustle somebody. I had another gear that other people didn't have, and I think that the training that we did at that time, directly just, you know, is a massive attribute to exploding when there was a lap or two laps to go, as long as I could have that reserve. But you needed the lane. You had to be able to technically, you could have the ice to do that, right?
Starting point is 01:51:16
There's got to be space. And so in short track speed skating, if I'm passing a skater in front of me, and we have some sort of a conflict or collision, I get disqualified. At the time, that's what the rules were. So you had to pass the other skater who was in front of me and we have some sort of a conflict or collision, I get disqualified. At the time, that's what the rules were. So you had to pass the other skater who was in front of you completely, cleanly with no contact. That puts a huge onus on the guy passing because he's got to take a huge distance. Well, they changed the rules after this, after this Olympics, but at the time, that's what the rules were.
Starting point is 01:51:42
And so it was very important to pass completely cleanly with no contact and incapacity. And I remember everyone knew that my inside passing lane was the best in the world. How many kilometers an hour are you guys going about 40? We're going around 35 plus miles an hour. Yeah, so you're going about 50 kilometers an hour. There is at that speed aerodynamics is everything. There's an enormous draft advantage if you can slingshot around someone, right?
Starting point is 01:52:08
And I could skate behind someone all day long and break world records because I was so comfortable, right? Anyone who could. But I wasn't very good at leading. For whatever reason, my technical ability would change and my track pattern would change. Which is so interesting given that you still broke, you still had that time trial world record
Starting point is 01:52:24
like going under 125, because there's no one blocking the win for you there. Right. But later on in my career, that became less and less of a big attribute of mine. So I was less and less a good time trial or more and more of a good racer, so to speak. About a lap and a half to go in the 1500 meters, I'm actually in fifth place.
Starting point is 01:52:42
I pass three skaters on the inside to pass into second place. Now, there's a lap remaining. It's me and Kim Dong-sung. I know that there's only one... I'm actually doing this probably a lap too late. I probably should have done this earlier, but I didn't wait a little bit too long looking back. And I tried one last pass on him on the inside. I recognized right away that he had known that I was going to be passing on the inside. So he had protected that inside lane position. And he really, really came over to protect that position as much as possible. And I wanted to make sure there was no contact in the capacity. So I put my arms up to show the referee who was in the corner. Look, there's no
Starting point is 01:53:19
contact. I'm not pushing him. There's nothing going on. And I slipped back in a second finish the race. He ends up getting disqualified, even though he finishes the race and wins. He had been parading around his South Korean flag and celebrating in victory. My coaches knew that there was going to be a call being made. And why was he disqualified? So at the time, there was something called cross tracking. So even though you're not so, you're supposed to, if you come out of the corner, you're supposed to maintain your lane. You're maintain your lane effectively.
Starting point is 01:53:46
You're lane, right? So if you come out of the corner and there's technically an inside lane, you can't immediately cut it off. Right, like blocking. And so he was a squalphite, I was a word of the gold and thus began this crazy relationship with the country of South Korea
Starting point is 01:54:02
that I would have never been able to explain. And so you get a silver when you showed a head of gold, you get a gold that you feel, is this really a silver? Yeah, it wasn't a clean win, right? That's very clear, but I was awarded it. And at the end of the day, a win is a win. And so I celebrated it as such. So this time you get to hear your national anthem for the first time.
Starting point is 01:54:22
I hear my national anthem. What is that like? For the first time. It's incredible. It's everything you can think it to be. But the first time. I hear my national anthem. What is that like for the first time? It's incredible. It's everything you can think it to be. But we sit there. I remember watching that on TV. I remember where I was watching that on TV.
Starting point is 01:54:32
And it's like, I don't know you. But it's still emotional for us to watch this, right? And to sort of, I think we put ourselves in the shoes of like these kids, right? And we think like, wow, I can't imagine the sacrifice they just went through. The difference between winning and losing seems to be almost random, stochastic, if you will. Right.
Starting point is 01:54:54
But you did it. Wow, I can't believe it. You're standing there. And I mean, I think that's why we just love the Olympics, even sports that we don't necessarily pay attention to outside of the Olympics, right? I think the fascination is, like, we know these athletes aren't doing it for money, because there is no money in the Olympics space, you know, with the exception of like the
Starting point is 01:55:12
.001%. And you know how much they dedicate. You know that four and eight and 12 years of their life is dedicated towards this one moment. And there's a sense of purity associated with that, that they really, truly do it because they love the sport. They want to go to the Olympic Games and they want to be the best against the world's best. And I think we can appreciate that. Now, you won two more medals in O2, didn't you? No, I won.
Starting point is 01:55:34
I just won those two medals. You did, okay. So you didn't win on the relay that year? No, one of the guys fell on the relay. I feel like we would have won gold, actually. The head ain't not falling. Which has got to be tough. I mean, you always feel bad. I follow swimming much more closely,
Starting point is 01:55:47
obviously, in any other sport, but it's always just the saddest thing for me when I see a guy on the swim, on the four by whatever this thing is. And when that one person has a bad leg, you feel worse for them than you feel for the other swimmers who swam their best. Cause like, it's just hard.
Starting point is 01:56:04
And I always sort of think it's beautiful when people can soul the one guy who has the bad race or the one girl who has the bad race. Yeah, in short track speed skating, it's such a variable. We grow up with that mentality. We call it that short track. That's the equivalent of shit happens, right?
Starting point is 01:56:19
It's just that short track. That short track. Like, look man, like you plan everything. You are the best. You've been undefeated for years. You get to Olympic Games. Boom. You fall down. Shit, that's short track. Like, look man, like you plan everything. You are the best. You've been undefeated for years. You get to the Olympic Games. Boom. You fall down. Shit, that's short track. Like, that's the sport that you sign up for. And if you can't subscribe to that mentality, you chose the wrong sport. But short track to me is very much like life, very much like
Starting point is 01:56:38
life, right? You can do everything right. And for whatever reason, something out of your control gets thrown in your way and you have to take it as such and learn from it, obviously, and come back stronger and better. But for the most part, I think that's what it is. But you became one of the really few athletes that rose above the sport, at least from a commercial standpoint. I mean, they're obviously a handful of Olympic athletes that we can all name that end up on the were you on the cover of a Weedies box? I was on the cover of Weedies box. That's that's like about as as American as it might not be necessarily the most lucrative commercial opportunity, but it is certainly the most distinguished right? I mean, to be on the Weedies box is sort of it's always a dream. Yeah. So I'm not going to ask you to sort of explain why you think you rose
Starting point is 01:57:21
to that level. How much of it do you think had to do with just what you did on the ice versus something about you that sort of captivated people's interests that goes beyond just the performance? Like, obviously you're a good-looking guy, you're articulate, your story is incredibly interesting as evidenced by the fact that we could sit here and talk about this for like six days.
Starting point is 01:57:41
And you also seem very comfortable in that role too. Like it wasn't, you get to send some athletes are really uncomfortable with that. They're appreciative of it, and it's this great opportunity to sort of remunerate some of their success. But you seem like totally natural in that role, right? I think, yeah, I mean, I was extremely blessed to be able to be one of the few athletes that both NBC chose and wanted to feature as a star athlete. And my story for whatever reason, and I think look, immigrant father comes to the US, doesn't
Starting point is 01:58:13
have anything, tries to raise this kid, this kid is bad, finds his life through sport, turns it around, understands the power that he has throughout the sport. And then against all odds, I was able to deliver in some capacity. And I didn't deliver a gold nephers race. It was a silver. Well, it was a scrappy silver. I mean, I think that's in some ways, I think, people much prefer, like if you had gone out, you know, I don't know what the expression is in speedcating, but if you'd gone wire to wire, right, if you'd time trial that event, and one by five lengths, or you know, five lengths, or by five body lengths or whatever, it's like, okay, wow, he's
Starting point is 01:58:50
dominant. But to fall, cut your leg, barely know which ways up and down and manage to really take the group before that you're racing against and be the first one across the line, that's a heartfelt silver that I think most people probably find more appealing and actually probably creates a better substrate for the way we like to use sport as metaphor for life. I think that's exactly, I couldn't have articulated it better. I think that we, Americans, look, we love dominance, we love to win, but we also like to see a story that somewhat mirrors what we can relate to. And it wasn't perfect in any way.
Starting point is 01:59:27
But I think at the end, I also didn't want to cross the line. And even though I was upset at a win gold, I didn't want to show that. I didn't want to be like, hey, I should have won gold. That guy, that Australian guy, shouldn't have been in the final. He's not a good skater. I didn't want to have or be near that type of a mentality. Instead, I had an opportunity, I think, to be really, really appreciative and have gratitude for the chance to even be there.
Starting point is 01:59:51
Number one, even though I was supposed to win the race, but take it from that perspective and then just like, I won my first Olympic medal, you know? Like, that's, look, this is how the race played out, not to plan, not exactly how I would have written it, but this is how it went. And I've been through a lot personally to get to that point, and I really, really wanted people to see that I was proud to win that silver. I was proud to win a bronze. I was proud to be there and compete. That was really important for me to people to recognize and see that I didn't take it lightly. I didn't take it for granted, like I'd done in the past. And it was something that I was humbled by.
Starting point is 02:00:30
And I mean, I got to the start line in that race and people were chanting my name like in the arena. I mean, I'm 19 years old. That is not normal of any stretch of the imagination. Yeah, I got to imagine that's different even from the world. It's like that's a totally different experience, right? It feels so different. It's a now our camera, my face, every second,
Starting point is 02:00:49
every inch that I move around. And there's immense pressure. I hear people in the audience who I don't know Apollo bring home the gold, you know, like, and I can feel like the actual genuine authenticity that exists within saying bring home that like people really, really want to meet a win. Yeah, and you've alluded to it already,
Starting point is 02:01:08
but this was only what for months after 9-11? This was still a very unified country in a way that I don't know that we've experienced since. Yeah, I'm walking in the opening ceremonies in Salt Lake City from our staging area to inside of the time, it was called the Delta Center. That's where the opening ceremonies were. And I remember seeing on all of the rooftops
Starting point is 02:01:28
and in the trees, all of the American servicemen, snipers, they're sitting there. And I remember looking up and seeing them and they, they're, they're, because they know it's us, right? Because they've got their, they're by now, those on the goggles and they wave. And I'm like, this is much bigger than me.
Starting point is 02:01:44
My representation of what I do, my silly sport of short track speed skating, I'm not going to lose on the goggles and they wave. And I'm like, this is much bigger than me. My representation of what I do, my silly sport of short track speed skating, my insignificance of going in circles in this world, and I'm 19, so I can't really understand it to that degree, but the feeling is there that what I do here is far more important than the results that I give. Obviously, I want to win. I want to bring home the color gold, because that is what we signify with being successful.
Starting point is 02:02:10
But at the end of the day, I wanted the representation of who I was on the ice at that period of time to reflect, I think, what we would be proud of. And that would make my father proud. And I knew if I had that happen, that I could be proud, that our country would be proud, aside from all the other conflict
Starting point is 02:02:27
and things that we disagree with, that was a really important part of what I was doing. And it's a tremendous amount of pressure too. You don't recognize, no one can prepare you for the Olympic Games. I used to do visualization in here and have previous tapes recorded and then try to visualize, close my eyes
Starting point is 02:02:42
and visualize a race that I wanted to have happen while the crowd is in my ears. But when I went out there for my first race, I couldn't, nothing could have paired for me for that. My heart rate jumped from like, whatever being like 50 to like 160, like literally within seconds. Oh.
Starting point is 02:02:55
And I was like, oh my god, like I'm starting this nine lap race now at threshold versus, this is not as well as what's going to work. You know, like I'm not paired for. Those six by 1000s are paying off now. Yeah, that's also's going to work. You know, like I'm not prepared for. Those six by one thousand are paying off now. Yeah, that's also a very addictive feeling. So what's the let down like after the two weeks? After the games are over?
Starting point is 02:03:11
Yeah. Well, it depends on how you do. So you've done well. You've obviously got a great commercial career ahead of you. But you still have four years until you're going to be back on that stage again. You'll go to the worlds again, you'll do World Cup, but you're not going to feel that electricity for four more years, right?
Starting point is 02:03:28
Correct. And nothing replaces the Olympic games. There's no competition on the planet. So post games, I go on the media whirlwind tour for basically six to eight months. I do every single interview and conversation and sponsorships and commercial advertising stuff because that's the only way you, as an Olympic athlete, can generate any sorts of revenue. You're not really paid to win gold medals. You're not paid to be a part of the team. You're just there. And so what percentage of Olympians United States Olympians
Starting point is 02:03:54
can secure enough sponsorship that that can become a sole source of income to sustain them through another Olympic run? I.e. they do not need to go out and get another job. Maybe less than a percent. Well, for sure less than a percent because even if you win a gold, it doesn't necessarily guarantee you to have a good generating of income. If for whatever reason you weren't featured or NBC didn't see you or sponsorships aren't interested, you're a guy with a gold medal.
Starting point is 02:04:21
And I know a few who have one gold who have the most normal jobs that we normally would see, like, wow, that guy won gold. And why is he working here doing this? Like day-to-day activity, like this manual labor, but that's just the reality of what happened. So I was blessed, I didn't have to do that. I got great sponsor level opportunities. And I took the sport of short track speed skating,
Starting point is 02:04:40
which was relatively completely unknown to most Americans. And the first time they ever saw it was that thousand meters in which I fell down and people were like, oh my God, this is the craziest sport I've ever seen in my life. And if it was like roller derby, yeah, that's what people say. NASCAR on ice, we call it, right? And it's crazy. It's fun. It's fast.
Starting point is 02:05:00
It's explosive. There's strategy. It's unpredictable. There's crashes. It's aggressive. The only thing, you know, if they just allowed you to punch each other, it would be like the next American checkbox. You know? Like, they should be like, carry knives too.
Starting point is 02:05:12
You should at least be able to like, you know, close line somebody, right? Yeah, that would be, we'd get some different looking aliens on the ice, that's for sure. There's so many other things I want to talk about and I realize like we're getting looks out there because they want us to go out for dinner. So let's talk about O6 and 10.
Starting point is 02:05:29
So, you know, one of the things you've told me before that I was blown away by was the difference in your body weight between 2002, 2006 and 2010. Most athletes who go from being 19 to 23 to 27 are putting on more muscle or getting bigger and bigger. You're maintaining muscle and getting leaner and leaner and leaner. Remind me again the difference between your fighting weight in those three Olympics. Sure.
Starting point is 02:05:56
So in 2002, the training focus was power, ballistic strength, and speed. Those are the important factors in that time period. Do you remember how many watts you could generate for a minute on a bike on an ERG? I don't remember. I have to ask Dr. Randy Wilber, who's, I think he's still the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs,
Starting point is 02:06:16
ahead of the first session. You got to, you got to like, get all that data and send it to me like, I want so badly to see your LPCs and your wattages and stuff like that. I don't know if it was just sick. It was good stuff like that. I don't know if it was just sick. It was good. I don't know if it was like astronomically high. I've heard these other stories of other athletes who were short track speed skaters to
Starting point is 02:06:32
be just freak in every genetic response. But my ability was to recover really quickly. That was the one component. I remember doing a test in, I remember doing all these different sports science tests. I remember these doctors basically saying like, you need to live at altitude. Like your body responds extremely well. The higher you go, whatever reason your body just produces a ridiculous amount of red blood cells, you come down and you, you love it. So in your ability to recover high or low is, is, is different.
Starting point is 02:07:02
Yeah. The first time I trained at altitude, I got to go and swim in Colorado. I was like, I'm not swimming, I'm not doing the same stroke. Like nothing feels the same up here. I couldn't believe it. Yeah, I think Colorado is like 6,400 feet. I think you're the elevation.
Starting point is 02:07:20
And back then we just, we lived high and we slept high. It's a really high time we trained. I think today isn't the conventional wisdom. You want to live high, train low. Doesn't that produce the best income? Correct. That's correct. So you're better off actually having a tent and training at sea level.
Starting point is 02:07:35
Yeah. And then like there's some arguments against the entire tent related, what type of stress that places on the human body and is that is it natural form of stress and do you get the proper response? There's some arguments back and forth that Dr. Renny Wilber was like, no, I think the actual natural environment far exceeds something that you can try to explain to me, obviously, I didn't understand. So in 2002, you're weighing what? So in 2002, I weighed approximately 164 to 167. So call it 165, right? That was my fighting weight. And I could like press around 1,400, 1,450, 1,500 pounds, like on it.
Starting point is 02:08:11
I'm just giving you just context. It was a small car. Like yeah. My back squat was never really that high. I think a lot of how to do it, just the way that I hinged. I was very good hunched over in that position. I could generate a lot of power
Starting point is 02:08:22
when my back is around it. Yeah, which you don't want to be squatting in that position, because it's complete opposite. But you were still probably be squatting in that position. Yeah, it's a complete opposite. But you were still probably what squatting? I think you said you were probably in the mid-300s for 12 reps. Yeah, about 350, 365, 75.
Starting point is 02:08:32
Which is still pretty, right? That's probably a max of 500. At a body weight of 160 is no slouch. Yeah, I mean, my vertical was really high. Yeah, I feel like it was really vertical. Almost like 36. Jesus. Do you know what your single leg vertical was? No, Almost like 36. Yeah, I feel like it was your vertical. Almost like 36. Jesus.
Starting point is 02:08:45
Do you know what your single leg vertical was? No, I don't remember that. Again, this is all stuff that I wished that we had docked because we trained so hard. I'm convinced by the way that single leg vertical is probably the best predictor of speed. Yeah, I think so. And did your ability to generate force in the ground? Yeah. I like to see the difference between doing a single jump and doing a series
Starting point is 02:09:05
of two or three and seeing that reaction time and generating a power over all these cool tools and ideas that I wish we had implemented. We probably had the ability, we just didn't implement them properly back then. So in O6, what did you weigh? O6 I weighed about 155 pounds, but I could still let press the same amount of weight. So I was significantly leaner in O6, significantly leaner. So long gone is the chubby boy.
Starting point is 02:09:29
Yeah, gone, we have new coaches, I know how the Chinese coach going in those games. These were in Italy this year, wasn't it? Yes, to Italy. And I performed very well in those games. I ended up winning a gold in the 500 meters. I won wire to wire, a controlled race did very well. Wasn't the best skater out there for sure,
Starting point is 02:09:45
but strategically it was my day. Did you also get a relay medal that year? Yes, we did. We got a bronze. And then what did you weigh in 2010? And then 2010, my goal was to be under 150. And I hadn't been under 150 since I was 14 years old. When I was 14 years, I was like 135, 137.
Starting point is 02:10:01
And then I ballooned back up, obviously. So my goal was to be 150, and I ended up competing at like between 142 and 146. So I would say like on average is about 143, 145 pounds. How much strength did you give up to get there? It was weird because I could leg press the same amount of weight. I could leg press nearly 2,000 pounds at that weight,
Starting point is 02:10:22
like 1900 or something like that, right? The difference was my pure ballistic power was drastically different. I stopped doing all Olympic lifts. So were you doing a lot of plyometrics? A lot of weighted plyometrics. But again, I cut most of that weight that year, like that Olympic season. So you can imagine, like the first half of the year was spent just cutting this weight. So essentially living in a catabolic environment all the time to eat excess muscle mass from
Starting point is 02:10:48
your upper body, traps, arms. I had no, I think that picture, my arms were so skinny back then, it was very similar to what you'd see in someone who's climbing in a toy. I remember Lansing that during the two years, he wouldn't do one push up or swim one lap in the spring and going into it because it's like you had to be able to waste as much muscle as possible from the upper body. You want complete atrophy from the hips up.
Starting point is 02:11:17
And there's a crazy stories of we hear that like these cyclists would like basically put themselves in a sling in the summers, we're doing their training, right? There's a lose all this way. And the reason why, and people are like, why would you want that body tape? Those people that ask that question
Starting point is 02:11:30
have never written a bike up a hill. That's all I'm gonna say. Every bound count, every factor. It is. I mean, cycling in many ways is such a beautiful sport because there are a few sports that can be reduced to such formulaic outcomes. And when you can take functional threshold power divided by mass in kilos and get a number in watts per kilo
Starting point is 02:11:48
that essentially predicts who's gonna win the race up a hill, that's pretty amazing. And speed skating, it's harder because, one, I don't know what the metric is of power, but two, absolute power to translate to a bike is much easier, like you're transmitting from the leg to the pedal to the crank to the wheel. But in skating, there's more to it, right?
Starting point is 02:12:10
It's not entirely clear what the relationship is between the 2,000 pounds that you can leg press versus how many of those pounds in watts are hitting the ice, right? It's probably not a correlation. Or it's probably loose correlation, but it's a correlation. But everyone's different because if you can't put the power... Yeah, you don't have the technique, it's not a correlation. Or it's probably loose correlation, but it's a correlation. Yeah, yeah. But everyone's different, because if you can't put the power... Yeah, if you don't have the technique, it's irrelevant. Yeah, so like, like a bike, the technique is pretty simple. Yeah, it's a push and pull at the basic level, right?
Starting point is 02:12:33
But in speed skating, there's seven parts to one push. Literally, there's seven parts to one push that you have to drill in, you're going to make it automatic and normal. And you're never on just one plane of balance on that piece of blade. You're in the heel, now you're in the middle, now you're back towards the heel, and then you finish at the ball or towards the toe. And it's different depending on the speed,
Starting point is 02:12:53
what you're doing, the track pattern. There's so many elements that are always changing. For example, the Koreans, they don't lift weights. Right? That became my obsession. This started in 2002. Yeah, because you went to Korea, didn't you? I went to Korea.
Starting point is 02:13:07
Before 2010. In 2007, because I was so obsessed and fascinated with how they continuously kept producing incredible athletes that I was competitive against. And they just skated so beautiful. Now, you were at this point, pretty much a god to them and they were gods to you. Did they welcome you with open arms?
Starting point is 02:13:24
They did, actually. They invited me, and partially because I think they were gods to you. Did they welcome you with open arms? They did, actually. They invited me, and partially because I think they just wanted to study me. They just wanted to see like what made me tick? Well, how strong is my ability to train? Can I handle their type of training atmosphere and environment? And I was fascinated to go into the belly of the beast.
Starting point is 02:13:38
Like I wanted to go into that lion's den and understand what makes them tick. And my dad was completely against it, but I was like, this is something I have to do. And eventually he was like, this is something you have to do. Why was your dad against it? So after the 2002 Olympic Games,
Starting point is 02:13:53
there was after that race where I was awarded the gold and the Korean students, it was for. Oh, that's right. There was 16,000 emails sent in the form of death threats to the United States Olympic Committee because of that race to me. It was pretty crazy. So it was, again, it was a time where my relationship with Korea changed overnight.
Starting point is 02:14:13
We ended up not going to Korea for two years for competitions because we were unsure of the environment. When you say we, you mean you and your dad or the US team? No, we're in the US team. We none of us went. I mean, my face was on a toilet paper inside the country. Like, I was the second most hated person, aside from Osama bin Laden inside that country. Literally. Unbelievable. It was unbelievable. We can talk about this other thing, like, for two hours, I have a thousand stories
Starting point is 02:14:34
in relation to that. And like, when I actually decided to go against everyone's wishes, I was like, I can't just keep running from this problem. I gotta go. The number one, they haven't heard me tell my story. Like, they hate me for reasons that are unexplainable, and also they're not really that fair because they don't know me. I'm not a referee. I didn't make the judging call. I am an athlete. I'm a sportsman.
Starting point is 02:14:55
I compete like anyone else does under the same rules and capacities. I walk away regardless of outcome. It was a changing time. The Koreans were always number one. I was the only threat at the time to them and their legacy. And it was a huge, huge part of my fascination with actually saying, you know what, I gotta go there. Even though they're gonna study me, I have to go and understand. It's like someone going to train with you saying bolt in Jamaica for like three months. And seeing, what is he doing? Is he doing some exercise?
Starting point is 02:15:25
What are the eating? What are the sleeping habits? What are the recovery? How do they get massage? Right? What kind of all these elements? And you already knew that they weren't doing the type of off-ice work that you were. What surprised you the most about what they did on ice? The two things that I recognized right away was their efficiency in training. There was no talking when you're on the ice. There was all business. When you shut up at the ice rink at four in the morning, four-thirty in the morning, there was already probably 30 skaters there who were eight to 12 years old, who had been practicing technical drills before you even got there.
Starting point is 02:15:57
So their commitment to perfection in terms of technique is drilled in at a very young age. So their efficiency ratio, they don't have to be as strong as me in the weight room young age. So they're efficiency ratio. They don't have to be as strong as me in the weight room because there's so much more efficient. That's what it came down to. This by the way has another beautiful parallel to swimming, right? I mean, unlike cycling, in swimming, the relationship between the power you can actually generate and how you can transmit it to the water is elusive.
Starting point is 02:16:23
And I don't know if the guy who wins the race is necessarily the strongest on land. It really doesn't matter. It's so much more about avoiding drag and efficiently putting your muscle into the go. So in that sense, it's much more like skating where there are certain swimmers who have some of the most unimpressive physiques.
Starting point is 02:16:40
I mean, Phelps has such an impressive physique to begin with. It's sort of the best of both worlds, but there are some really ridiculously scrawny looking pathetic swimmers who like biscuit chested dudes that can't, like literally can't do anything, but when they get in the water, they sure as hell can do some. Sure. It's very much the same way with speed skating, and I saw that.
Starting point is 02:17:03
And when I, the first thing I recognized was their ability to copy each other was unlike anything I've ever seen. When you go watch a US short track speed skating practice, everyone skates entirely different. You can pick out who's who. When you watch a Korean speed skating practice, they all look the same. You can set a couple of guys there stand out,
Starting point is 02:17:21
but for the most part, in its beautiful walk, they're very quiet. They make a lot of noise when they go around the corner. They're extremely efficient. And I remember the first day that I showed up, we broke like five-world records in that practice. And two of the girls who were leading by the way, in the in the 3,000 meter, we did five times, 3,000 meters, five times, 27 laps. Two of the girls I never ended up seeing for the next couple of years. They never made the team. And they were the ones who were leading this from start to finish breaking the world record So they just have a mass talent pool of
Starting point is 02:17:50
skaters that they can just pick and choose from and just like the old school Eric Hyden era of like survival of the fittest we're gonna pick out the pure genetic monsters who not only technically are the most efficient But also can handle the greatest amount of volume and load and training, they are going to rise to the top. And usually the South Korean skaters only last one or two Olympics at the absolute most before they're just gone. And they just like literally overnight, they just get replaced by the next cog in the mission. They can't make the team.
Starting point is 02:18:20
Wow. Yeah. So my whole goal for showing up in Vancouver was, in 2002, I was dominant. 2006, I had won a gold, probably could not have replicated that. And in 2007, I was losing my dominance in the sport significantly, and people were skating so fast, and there was a... Was that mostly just apparent to you or do you... Because usually the athletes, the first to figure that out.
Starting point is 02:18:42
Yeah. Or was it also visible to those around you? I think people started to notice that I was no longer this undefeatable, unrecognizable, unknown mystery athlete from the US. Everyone knew my strategy. Everyone knew my natural gate and rhythm of skating. And it was like, do or die. I wasn't dominant. And I wasn't winning. I was winning, but I wasn't winning with the same fashion I was where people were like, oh my god, that guy just smashed the pack. So was there a period then between 07 and 10
Starting point is 02:19:08
when you were even wondering if you would come back? Well, you was not wondering if I was in a convex I'd already committed it was more, how do I actually get to the games and have a chance at meddling? That was the conversation. Like how can I win against this next generation of South Korean athletes that have never faced before
Starting point is 02:19:23
who are so fast and so good. How old are they? You're now 25, right? 26. Yeah, they're 18, 19, 20. That was usually the range. Which is interesting because if you really think about it for a male speed-based sport, you should still be able to peak in your mid-20s.
Starting point is 02:19:38
Yep. For whatever reason, it was always a young man's sport, short track speed skating. And the other was going to do it with flexibility and the way in which you move. And maybe there's no correlation in the capacity, but that's just what it was. In 2002, a lot of the heavier guys had a retire before 2006. They couldn't meet the cut. The sport had changed.
Starting point is 02:19:55
In 2006, 2010, a whole next generation of guys were tired because again, they couldn't meet the cut. The way that we trained, the focal points, what was important during training, the elements that made you a fast speed skater are all changed. And we had a big coaching turnover, so we went from a Chinese coach.
Starting point is 02:20:10
I had a, originally I had a Canadian coach, American coach, to then a Chinese coach, to then two Korean coaches, who threw everything out the window when it came to sports science, and said, we are gonna take you Apollo, and change the way that you technically skate. And physiologically, my goal was
Starting point is 02:20:25
to show up as a different type of an athlete that they would never prepare for. So I want to change my natural gate and rhythm. I can't help but bring the Rocky metaphor back. This is when Rocky comes back to fight clobber-line. Very similar, yeah. Because he gets killed by clobber, fighting rocky style. Correct. And then Apollo comes back to train him. I'm grinning as I say this because I realize it sounds so stupid, but it's really the example, right? It's like, you can't come back and fight clubber the same way. You got to lose like 15 pounds and you actually have to box instead of slug.
Starting point is 02:20:51
Correct. If I want to be competitive, if I took the same strategy of success from 2006 and 2010, I won't make the semi-final. That's apparent. And so that meant I had to make drastic changes. And you realized this by 07? By 07, I have to make a change. So you had three years to change everything. After I had gone to Korea and skated and recognized
Starting point is 02:21:10
and knew what I was really up against and saw this next generation of South Korean athletes who were training there that would be the ones that I would compete against. And also recognize also when I stepped on the ice in 2010 and look in the coaches box and see that I would have skated against 80% of the coaches because they all had retired and became coaches of those national teams who were then coaching
Starting point is 02:21:27
their athletes to beat me. They know me better than anybody. They had seen me for 15 years at point, right? Technically. So the goal was to show up as someone who they couldn't prepare for. Different strategy, different mentality, different training, and that meant drastic decisions and changes. And so I hired a strength and conditioning coach who lived with me at my house in Salt Lake City, Utah, to watch and monitor every single thing that I ate, every single extra training regime that we did. And I was the guy that I was never like, you never had to push me to train more. It was like, okay, we need to figure out how to rest. Yeah, like let's figure out how to do some things a little bit better, better here. And so it became a huge emphasis on recovery, a massive emphasis on nutrition,
Starting point is 02:22:06
which is recovery. And just making sure that everything that I was doing was correlating with my end result, which was being, let's be this light, let's maintain this strength. And I know, if I can at least do those two things, I've got the unique technical ability to at least get myself to the podium. And it was a struggle because I love to eat, I love food, I'm always hungry. And at 153, there's not a lot of weight to lose. Like, like, like, my skin was very thin around my legs. Like, I had, it was all muscle. So, I had to go catabolic. I had to lose excess muscle mass that wasn't being specifically derived from the sport. And perhaps was being generated from the weight training that we were doing, whether it was deadlifts,
Starting point is 02:22:47
whether it was poles, whether, I mean, there was no more. I mean, in 2009, we were still doing bench press, right? It's a part of our weight training program. That's got, that makes no sense in terms of... Even those cleans really, I mean, you can argue, there was obviously an explosive benefit of the cleanser. Two and a half to three pounds there, probably, upper body mass, right?
Starting point is 02:23:06
That you just don't necessarily need. Now, the benefit from those is incredible. And looking back, I probably should have incorporated some specific type of Olympic or deadlift like activity, but I was so hyper focused and obsessed with losing weight. I remember writing down on these little Post-it notes and putting them all throughout my house, the wait. And then like zero regrets. Like make sure you get to the Olympic Games
Starting point is 02:23:30
with zero regrets. Regardless of your outcome there, you have to arrive leaving absolutely no stones unturned in your preparation. You wrote a book by this title years later. Yeah, that was just because that was my mentality. And I was doing dumb workouts. I had two training sessions with the Olympic team and then we would do an additional one or two on top of that every
Starting point is 02:23:53
day of the week with the exception of Saturday and Sunday, which was peer recovery. Saturday morning, we would skate Saturday afternoon, it was recovery Sunday, well, day was recovery. But the rest of the time I was doing these crazy sprints and intervals on a treadmill that my strength and conditioning coach could monitor and watch my gate. We would try to change the way that I naturally ran, so we increased the cadence. And I wanted to be a higher cadence athlete who had very high cadence versus the previous Apollo, which is all power, slow. And it was very hard. It's nearly impossible to change, but that was the goal point. And which is interesting, you come back through a cycling analogy here, right?
Starting point is 02:24:29
Which is today we see cyclists riding at a much higher cadence and a lower torque to generate comparable power, shifting the load to the cardiovascular system from the muscular system. Yep, and all comes down to efficiency, right? Generate the least amount of lactic acid and increase the amount of speed and repetitions that you're crossing over in the corner.
Starting point is 02:24:48
Without the more static you are on one leg, the more strength and lactic acid you essentially are producing. So if you can decrease the amount of time you are on each leg, the less likelihood you are to get tired as long as you're naturally able to do that. So, I mean, it was a real struggle. Like, I cracked on that treadmill. I cracked in the weight room all of the time.
Starting point is 02:25:10
And I questioned my path on that process. Cause you can imagine, right? I'm a guy here who, I have a recipe for success. I know what works. And now you're gonna abandon it. Not only do I abandon it, I go the complete opposite direction. And I change everything and everything that I know about what made me me in hopes that I would do this gamble and show up to Olympic Games and be the best of our ban and completely
Starting point is 02:25:34
unpredictable to the other athletes. And it remarkably worked out, but there was a lot of questioning in my head. And I remember many, many nights I'd lay in bed starving, so incredibly hungry, because I just, I for sure wasn't getting enough calories in my body, absolutely. And just like wondering, like, is this the right path towards success? Is this going to work? Because the last thing I want to do is get to the games and be like, shit, that was a bad decision. Right. And that's painful for so many reasons, not the least of which being you have just spent four years before you got that feedback, right?
Starting point is 02:26:08
It's one thing to say, you know, I'm gonna try this new way of washing my car today and see if it produces streaks or no streaks, and then you do it and it produces streaks, and you're like, well, okay, that was 30 minutes I wasted, but like, this is four years to figure out that the new washing technique streaks the car. Yeah, and for the first four and a half months, like I just wasn't skating very well. I was tired,
Starting point is 02:26:30
I was fatigued all the time. Other athletes on my team were better and skating faster than I was. I was doing workouts that I probably shouldn't have been doing at that late in stage. And the chatter is basically, he's sticking around for one too many Olympics. Yeah, and he's like lost his mind. Like he's like, what is he doing? Like look how much weight he's losing on like a monthly basis. But again, goes back to that psychological advantage of, this is what it took. And this is the place that I was in.
Starting point is 02:26:58
And to me, having that edge of going to a place where no one else went to, and also it's very personal, right? Going to a place where you never knew went to. And also, it's very personal, right? Going to a place where you never knew was possible. It's incredibly powerful. It's you have a sense of inner strength when you get to those Olympic games. And I hadn't raised a single race, but I was smiling before that even happened.
Starting point is 02:27:16
I felt so, like, weightless, not only because I'd lost 20 pounds from over my career, but because I just, I really felt prepared. Could I have done it differently? Absolutely. Could I've gone back and implemented sports, science, and other elements that we now know would have dramatically increased my performance ratio? Yes, but the process of going through that and hardening my mentality and going through those dark times where you're questioning yourself, being in a sauna alone, every day sweating and meditating and visualizing
Starting point is 02:27:48
to be your absolute greatest potential, thinking about not an almond more or an almond less that goes into your body like on a daily basis. That obsession is fatiguing, but also really beautiful thinking back. And I miss it immensely, but it was a huge burden and weightlessness and victory, personal victory that took a whole team to get me to that point
Starting point is 02:28:12
when I arrived at Vancouver and had an incredible Olympic Games. Didn't actually end up winning a gold in those games, but still feeling like I won and having the most consistent Olympics I ever had in my life. And that transition from 07, 08, 09 as you're completely changing your style, completely changing your body, changing the way you train, adjusting to a sport that is still basically
Starting point is 02:28:36
and probably a profound evolution. More so than the sport that's been around for hundreds of years or at least been in Olympics for 100 years, it's still in that growth curve of figuring out the balance between technical versus strength, versus power. What was it like to go back to Korea in, is it was in 07, you went back? To live in Korea was in 07. Yeah. And I know we sort of talked about this before, but you had kind of an interesting homecoming back to Korea post-02, right? Right.
Starting point is 02:29:07
Which was in 2004. We kind of glossed over that a little bit, but for two years, you didn't go back, right? Yeah, so after the 2002 Olympic Games, when I had won that gold medal in the 1500 meters and the South Korean was disqualified, thus began this really interesting relationship with the country of South Korea. And yeah, I mentioned that I was the second with the country of South Korea. And you guys mentioned that I was the second most hated person in South Korea. First was Osama bin Laden. We received 15,000, 16,000 death threats via email which crashed the United States Olympic
Starting point is 02:29:35
Committee's servers during the Olympic Games. So instantaneously we knew that that country was very unhappy with what had just happened. And it was a subjective call not made by me, but made by a referee who was the corner judge who decided to think that they was a cross-tracking penalty and I was awarded. Could have won either way if you replayed the race again with different judges. So fast forward to the 2002 World Cup,
Starting point is 02:29:59
soccer World Cup, and it was Korea versus United States, a Korean athlete, scores the first goal, Rips off his jersey, underneath the jersey, painted on his back is my last name, OHNO, oh no. And they essentially do a replay of that race on the soccer field and pretend and they throw the arms up and everything, basically showcasing that they think that was a misstep in the judging call
Starting point is 02:30:23
and I should not have been a more the gold. So they were really infatuated with that result. It was also a time in which I think anti-American sentiment within the country was at its prior peak. And you know, a lot of people were kind of pointing fingers about things that were happening inside the country that involved Americans and could have been penalized, should have been penalized for where their actions in the country and they weren't, and they were let off.
Starting point is 02:30:50
And so they thought that this was not okay. And you know, outside these decisions in courtroom areas that these things were happening, like people were chanting my name as if I had anything to do with any of those incidents and any capacity. So again, it was really sensitive time and it escalated even further because these death threats continued on throughout the year so much so that like my face was on toilet paper inside Korea where they were selling this. And you can imagine like that's a crazy thing to have happened.
Starting point is 02:31:20
I had a lot of friends who were in service who were in the country and they were like, dude, you are not liked in this country. Like do not come here. It's not okay. Like people, they don't even watch speed skating. They don't know the sport. They don't know you. They just know they're supposed to hate you. And so this spread, this nationalism inside South Korea was always strong and they're very patriotic people and very passionate. And they just, they got behind this thing that I was not the good guy. And we compete every single year in these world Cups, right?
Starting point is 02:31:45
So from 2002 to 2004, we had probably three World Cups that were supposed to be in Seoul. All three, we opted out not to go. Now those are important World Cups. Those give you the World Ranking in order to get best seated for your World Championship. So it had to be pretty devastating for us to not go. And we just didn't know what the threat was going to be. We didn't know if it was going to be real. We weren't certain of, all it takes is one crazy person to make an action
Starting point is 02:32:09
and something could happen. And my father definitely didn't want me to go and the only son he felt that the threat was real and he just wasn't worth it. He's only sport, right? Why would you put yourself in danger and at risk? And to me, I just, I felt, I was really hurt, I think emotionally, because I grew up
Starting point is 02:32:23
around the Korean culture. Like I was obsessed with the Korean skaters. I had Korean coaches. I looked up to them, I had Korean friends growing up in federally Washington and in Seattle, Washington, and I ate the food. I understood it. And so I just felt like it was very unwarranted because they never heard my side of the story and they didn't know me as a person, but instead I was judged by a preconceived notion
Starting point is 02:32:42
or speculation that was an accurate. So getting that across a huge language barrier is impossible. So my only thought was, well, in 2004, I have to go there. And so finally, we made the decision as a team to go to Seoul, to compete. And upon arrival, we were told that the risk is still there.
Starting point is 02:33:00
There's gonna be bodyguards, but I had no idea what to expect that an urban this position before. And upon arrival in Inchon International Airport, there was an empty baggage claim, meaning they cleared out the baggage claim, the area that we arrived at. And it was like 100 to 200, maybe 300 plus security guards and police who were standing shoulder to shoulder to block out the Korean media, in which there was like hundreds of people there and fans trying to take pictures and get interviews,
Starting point is 02:33:30
because it was like my first time coming back. So I'm like the second most hated person in the world. Now I'm back to compete on their home soil in their view to see who the best the best is. So this is their rematch, right? It's not the Olympics, but this is their rematch. This is their opportunity to prove for once in a while that it was a complete fluke that I won during those games
Starting point is 02:33:51
and it was the bad call. And the skater that you defeated in 02 was he still skating? He retired. So this wasn't even really about you and him anymore. This is about you and a country. It was about me and a country, about me versus South Korea, which is really insane for many other levels.
Starting point is 02:34:07
But looking back, it made me a lot stronger mentally and it made me train like a complete monster. Every waking moment, I was driven a lot by my pure fear that the guys on the other side of the world were better, more prepared, younger, or talented, genetically gifted, bodies suited for the sport of short track speed skating. And how can I beat them the only way I knew was just to be tougher, right? Mentally, be able to withstand pain thresholds that they would even dare step into.
Starting point is 02:34:40
That this is my mentality. It's the only way that I could make up for my lack of, you know, whatever God-given talent and abilities that I did or didn't have. And so, when I arrived in South Korea, I don't tell the story often because it's never came up. But the week prior, we were actually in China for another World Cup.
Starting point is 02:34:56
And usually whenever we go to China for the World Cup, they're held in like Harbin, Changchun, like these north-eastern regions of the country that are very cold, back then they just were not nice to visit. Skyscrapes of being built everywhere. Like it's just not a pleasant place to be in during that kind of infrastructure booming period. And you usually always got sick at some point.
Starting point is 02:35:19
Like the Chinese food was just not clean or we just didn't have the bacteria to fight. And so, you know, me being a guy who would like eat street food sometimes when I go over there, that was no longer an option. And all of my team got sick during that first week. And so we traveled the next week to South Korea. And typically when you go to a World Cup,
Starting point is 02:35:37
you arrive on a Monday, compete on a Friday. So you spend Monday through Thursday, adjusting to the climate, getting used to the ice conditions, understanding the climate, getting used to the ice conditions, understanding the environment, and essentially just preparing yourself for the competition. And so I was the only guy in my team who didn't get sick in China,
Starting point is 02:35:55
but upon that plane ride from China to South Korea, my stomach was starting to feel a little funky. Talk about bad timing, right? I'm going to the heart of the lion's den to be at my best. This race and this competition is a world cup. It means nothing over all that year. It's 2004. People don't care.
Starting point is 02:36:13
No one's paying attention. It's so intrinsically important for me to perform well at that competition. Nothing else matters that year because of all of the all these things that are encompassing. And so I arrive on Monday, on Tuesday, I have like really bad food poisoning from China. And it goes into Wednesday.
Starting point is 02:36:31
It goes into Thursday. And at this point, I'm like down 10 pounds. And what's normal for the type of training you would do on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday? I mean, this is like kind of like a dual meet in swimming, right? Where it's like, you're not shaved, you're not tapered, you're just sort of going through the motions. It's like, it's basically a meet that's a practice. Would you as be treating these meets that way?
Starting point is 02:36:52
More than a practice, but for sure, not as important as the World Championships and definitely not showing on your cards. So your ears would ideally train pretty hard the Wednesday Thursday. Yeah, so we arrive on Monday. We'll go for a run with the team, do some skating drills and exercises. Tuesday, we have a harder high intensity, we'll do like five times seven laps intervals, right, with like four to six minutes rest in between, pretty high intensity, 80 to 90% threshold. And then in the afternoon, we'll do some form of a plyometric jump training. And all this is, by the way, like fractions of what we would normally do in terms of training. So this to us is a complete rest. But you're not even able to do this based on the food poisoning like fractions of what we would normally do in terms of training. So this to us is a complete rest of which. Right.
Starting point is 02:37:26
But you're not even able to do this based on the food poisoning or you are sort of still going through the motions of these practices. I'm kind of going through the motions and by Thursday, it's pretty apparent that I'm full blown, like extremely dehydrated and starting to question whether I should even compete in the competition. Which is like an impossible choice to face because no one's going to buy the story that you didn't compete because you lost 10 pounds due to food poisoning.
Starting point is 02:37:49
Yeah, the story's gonna be, oh, you wimped out, you know that you didn't win effectively. Yeah, you're host. And then you show up and compete 10 pounds dehydrated. There's no win. It's lose, lose. And my father was actually there too in South Korea because he was really scared of my well-being.
Starting point is 02:38:04
And I was just assigned two bodyguards to follow me around the old competition in the entire time. And I remember walking in on Friday the first day of competition and getting on the ice and hearing all of the Korean fans literally booing and just being like, you know, I don't know what they're saying in Korean, but I'm sure something like like, you know, you're a little... It's probably not nice. It's not nice, you know, definitely take me out of the game. And you know, I performed okay, actually the first day.
Starting point is 02:38:30
I did not bad. And there's something about, and I'd love to really understand the science behind this, because I've had this repetition time and time again, whenever I got sick in my sport, I always perform pretty well for whatever reason, even through time trials. Do you think it just has to do with the forced rest that comes before it? Maybe forced rest, maybe the white blood cell count is a component. I mean, who knows what's really there? Maybe the immune system's working over time.
Starting point is 02:38:54
I don't know, but I mean, I'm exhausted. I physically feel terrible, but for some reason my output is still very, very, very high. This time was different because I'm pretty lean already. You drop all that water, I was drinking water. It was coming right out 10 minutes later. Like literally, it was just severe nasty food poisoning that lasted about three and a half days. And so, I get through the first day, I get through Saturday, the 500 meters. I was pretty much useless in the sprints for whatever we just had no strength. In between races on Sunday, which is the thousand meters
Starting point is 02:39:25
and the three thousand meters, I'm like lying on the floor, you know, like just trying to rest. And I ended up actually somehow just doing very well that competition and it wenting the thousand meter, winning the three thousand meter. So that meant like, this is Saturday Sunday. This is Sunday. So on Sunday is the big day, which means you skate
Starting point is 02:39:41
the thousand meter and the three thousand meter super final and then the relay. All in the same day. That's how the World Cup schedule usually works. It doesn't work that way in the Olympics, but it's very, very different. So I skated very well and I ended up winning the competition on the home soil. So how do the fans react to this? Well, you know, when I first got on on Friday, they were all booing and by the time I left, I would say 80% of them actually were clapping and they were cheering. And someone had leaked to the media that I was really sick during that time.
Starting point is 02:40:09
And I think that had a component of that. People understood that I actually was performing at subpar optimal levels and I still was able to somehow pull it off. And it was really mentally excruciating because I very much wanted to win. But not because I wanted to beat them, because I just, I wanted to prove. Like, to me, it was, it was like, look, I'm a legitimate. I was in a fluke. Like, I am a competitive athlete who on any given Sunday can win.
Starting point is 02:40:33
I may not win every 10 times, but I'll win at least one of those 10 times, right? And I wanted to showcase that and just kind of searching and, you know, reaching for respect because I didn't get that when I first arrived. Like, it was was like basically, you know, the thought process was you did not deserve to win and you cheated to win. And I didn't feel like I did. And so the only way to retract those statements from those people who were making them was to try to go there and win wholeheartedly, openly. And I did in that manner. And so that was so that was the first change in our relationship in terms of being the most hated to having respect for me as an athlete and as a sportsman to actually go into the airport
Starting point is 02:41:14
and then people having fan club signs. And this happened within the same trip. This happened the same. Meaning you described your arrival, but by the time you departed, the same Korean fans were cheering for you. The same Korean fans were cheering for me in the airport, with signs. And I remember the head of KSU at the time, Mr. Chang came to me. He's like, I don't know what you did or how you did it, but you're leaving here in a
Starting point is 02:41:35
much better place than you did when you arrived. Wow, that's awesome. You know, because that was the actual goal. My goal was not to defeat really them, but to just show them that I'm just to earn their respect. Yep. That's what it came down to and I did it in a convincing fashion. So it was awesome.
Starting point is 02:41:52
So between 0 4 and 0 7, you've obviously gone back to the Olympics. You've demonstrated that this isn't some fluke. You've earned their respect. And now in 0 7, you're going to actually train with them as you try to come back and make the Olympic team in 2010. Yep. So again, I go back into the belly of the beast. I go back to the place where no other... And they're embracing you now in a certain... But they are. But they're also, at the time, the South Korean short track team was very, very fenced off from the rest of the world in terms of their training methods. That was their secret sauce, right?
Starting point is 02:42:25
We don't understand why they're so good. How do they get that technique? How do they, they don't lift weights we hear, but they're so good. We watch them during training, and it looks like they're over-training. What do their bodies look like? I mean, designed for short track.
Starting point is 02:42:37
If you could be God, and you could make a perfect short track skater, tell me what their body looks like. So you take your pelvis, tilt it forward. So the complete opposite of what you do in a squat, do the complete opposite. Tilt your pelvis forward. Okay. And so your lower back is now rounded,
Starting point is 02:42:54
have a shorter torso, longer legs, thinner and frame naturally, and basically zero upper body weight, because then you can strengthen your lower body very easily. That sounds like a cyclist. Yeah. That's the tilt That sounds like a cyclist. Yeah. That's the till-to-put into a cyclist's thoracolumbar spine, no upper body, all lower body. That's how you design it.
Starting point is 02:43:13
And very, and strength-to-weight ratio that's strange throughout the chart. That's the perfect speed to get. And there's a few that exist. I actually wasn't one of them. My proportions are actually, my legs are a little bit too short, my torso's a little bit too long. And you're pretty muscular all around. Like you don't have that emaciated upper body. No, I didn't naturally. But the South Korean athletes, men and women had this naturally. And so when I watched them skate, I recognized right away. I was like, these guys aren't
Starting point is 02:43:40
thinking about their technique, whether they're going through the corner. It's natural. Like that they're just skating. It's like walking. You don't think about left, right, left, right. You just walk. When you go for a jog, the same thing. You're not thinking about which foot is in front of the other. That's what it's like when you don't understand speed skating.
Starting point is 02:43:55
You're thinking, let me tilt my left hip in. Let me put my right shoulder down. Maybe make sure that my shoulders and my hips are level with the ice no matter what angle I'm skating at. Make sure my nose, knees, and toes are in line at all times in all periods. I'm thinking about these things every corner because it's not natural.
Starting point is 02:44:11
Really, even, I remember you once telling me a funniest thing about how you would drive to the ring in that position. Yeah, it's obsessed. I mean, of course, we can't do it on the podcast because we don't, we don't have the visual, but like the image of you tilting yourself over this earring wheel, driving that way to mimic the corner, it never became autonomic.
Starting point is 02:44:34
You never got to the point where you could make that turn and perfectly line up without a single thought. I trained myself to do it automatically, but I don't think it was a natural feeling for me. It took years and hours and hours of obsessive driving with like all the weight on my right hip, with my left hip, you know, like imagine driving and you put all the weight on your right leg. And your left leg is not even touching the ground, okay? And your left hip is actually raised a little bit.
Starting point is 02:45:00
And your left hand is on the steering wheel and your right shoulder is down. Like that's an uncomfortable position to be in every single day, two and from the ice rink. I did it because I just wanted to feel natural. I wanted to skate as natural as I saw the other skaters skating. I love this kind of stuff. That's what I enjoy about having a discussion like this is, I think so many people, if they're watching you on TV or they're watching Phelps or they're watching Lance Armstrong or they're watching, you know, pick whatever great athlete, I think people just assume like it just came so
Starting point is 02:45:32
easy to them. But I don't think they realize that the best of the best have this ability to force themselves to do this type of work, which is not to say that there isn't a natural talent. I think the best of the best combined natural talent with sort of, you know, whatever, but you know, you don't even have the same sort of physical dimension advantage that some of your peers would have,
Starting point is 02:45:56
but it's this complete obsession. It's this like, who would even think, I'm gonna use the extra hour a day I'm driving to train speed skating? Yeah, it's all I cared about. It's all I thought was important. It's all that mattered in my life. And when you prioritize that as being the sole significant piece of your life from waking moment till you close your eyes, and hopefully when you're sleeping, you're thinking about it too, it changes your perspective on how you live your life and what actually you do on a daily basis to impact you. I mean, I want to come back to finish your career, but I can't help, but at the moment,
Starting point is 02:46:30
ask a question that I'm afraid I'll forget to ask if we go back to the Olympics, which is now that you're not a professional athlete, do you still have that level of focus, or is that something that is very difficult to maintain for a prolonged period of time? In other words, do you now relish the fact that you didn't have to think about what we had for dinner? You could eat as much as you wanted and you can now sit here comfortably and you're going to drive home tonight and you're not going to have to contort yourself into some crazy
Starting point is 02:47:02
position. I mean, what's the new guidance system you've applied to the missile that is your life? It definitely have the same, I think, quirks that I did from sport that are transferring over to my life. I now recognize them. You know, when I was training as an athlete,
Starting point is 02:47:17
I didn't recognize them. I didn't know what they were. I just thought that that's what I did. This is the things that me driving in that way to the ice rink was normal. That's not normal. That's not even normal for an is the things that me driving in that way to the ice ring was normal. That's not normal. That's not even normal for an athlete. It's really not.
Starting point is 02:47:29
By borderline unhealthy, psychologically, to be that obsessed at that level all the time. There wasn't one day I went to the ice ring. I didn't wake up and didn't want to be there because I was, it was in a choice. There was no, do I want to go do a not, that was even a conversation. So now, constantly in the different projects that I have and delving into areas where I don't have the experience I don't have the time spent and education It really helps because I completely immerse and I spent hours and hours and hours on certain elements. Is it in the same intensity? Probably not. It's difficult to Is it in the same intensity? Probably not.
Starting point is 02:48:05
It's difficult to relate that in the same way, but for sure the traits and attributes that I developed as a short track athlete, for absolutely sure they are beneficial attributes to apply towards specific parts of life. And also just the fact of feeling like, when you look at life, no matter how bad shit gets, you can always come back. No matter how sick, no matter how bad shit gets, you can always come back.
Starting point is 02:48:25
No matter how sick, no matter how tired I am, I was able to compete, right? I was able to train now in doing business or relationships, taking the same kind of mentality of saying, like I've done things physiologically, I never thought was possible. I broke through barriers mentally that I think were really powerful.
Starting point is 02:48:42
And how do you apply those with an open mind and with a way that's a different perspective on life? I'm much softer as a person now than I was back then. I was so rigid in every element you can imagine and tight actually. And with my time, with the way that I viewed, I think the world, with the way I viewed my teammates, it made me probably unpleasant to be around on the ice
Starting point is 02:49:04
most of the time because I just didn't, I made me probably unpleasant to be around on the ice most of the time because I just didn't, I wasn't there to make friends. Would you have significant relationships with girlfriend or something during that period of your life? Kind of off and on, but none that really were, no, nothing that I would really say like this was, you know, not like what you enjoy today. No, totally different, but my view is different. My life really kind of began after I retired from the sport.
Starting point is 02:49:27
I learned so much through it, but I really recognized that my life began when I decided to not come back to the sport. And it was really beautiful to be able to do that. Why is it that many athletes can't articulate what you just said on two levels, the first being, I'm amazed at the number of athletes that I meet who once they're done with their sport, they can't seem to apply that greatness to
Starting point is 02:49:50
the next chapter. In other words, they've clearly worked hard. They've clearly learned to do something well, even when no one's looking, because that's basically what most of practice is. But they really struggle to make that leap. And then secondly, for many athletes, sadly, once the lights are gone, once nobody knows your name, there seems to be this depression that sets in, and maybe depression might be too far on the pendulum, but there's this sense of their other purposes over, right?
Starting point is 02:50:22
They don't think about what that next chapter looks like. Did you struggle with any of those things at all? And I mean, we just seeing you now on the other side of that where it's, it looks like everything's worked out. I mean, was there ever a challenge where you thought, oh my God, I don't ever get to carry a flag. I don't ever get to put a medal on my neck. I don't ever get to be on TV for being the best athlete or something. I mean, was that a transition? It was an incredibly difficult transition. And one that I don't talk about that much, but I don't care who you are.
Starting point is 02:50:50
And I heard a podcast, I'm gonna say like a couple of years ago, which I really resonated with it. And it was talking about seals coming home from war and feeling so out of place in normal society that they can't wait to go back. I think they love war. They hate war. They don't like what it is. But they probably love the purpose. They have a prairie in the purpose.
Starting point is 02:51:11
And they feel like this is what they're supposed to do. There's a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose. Like you said, in the Olympic space, you have one single focus for a long time, four, eight, 12 years. Nothing in your life matters more than that sport. And everything you do is generated to be important in that sport. And if you win, you're celebrated, which makes it even more dangerous. Because now there's a level of expectation that you are going to carry this flag further.
Starting point is 02:51:40
And like you said, there's a ton of attributes that you create as an athlete that are incredible life lessons that you create as an athlete that are incredible life lessons that you learned through sport. They're amazing. The problem is when you retire from an athlete, you've now dedicated most of your adult life towards this one specific task that has absolutely zero relevancy to life. I went in circles in spandex for most of my adult life. Well, most of my younger adult life, right? And now I retired, I didn't intern, I wasn't working at Goldman Sachs as a finance guy. I don't have experience working as a job.
Starting point is 02:52:10
And now I'm thrust in the spotlight to go and basically act and interact in normal society. If you didn't make money, you didn't win medals, then what do you do? Like basically you sacrifice the first 12 years of your life that you normally from the age of 18 to 28. Those are so incredibly important to gain expertise and experience and social skills
Starting point is 02:52:29
and personal development and try anything that you want and fail at them and still okay and get back up. You didn't have that opportunity. You're now starting out as an 18 year old, but you're now 28 years old. And so that's the challenge is, from a competitive perspective, when you've got a corporate
Starting point is 02:52:45
energy looking at hiring or perhaps you want to get a new job, like, hey, that's great. You got a year in Olympic athlete. I know you probably work hard. I know that you probably spent a lot of time doing this, this and this, but you've got zero work experience. You didn't finish college. You don't have any idea what it takes to be here. Like, maybe I'll take a risk on you.
Starting point is 02:53:03
Maybe I won't. It's a difficult position to be in. But on top of all of that stuff, you have to look at the actual psychological issues that exist. And that's where it really, really gets dark. I'm not excluded from that. I was so fearful in 2008 that when I retired in 2010, I wouldn't find my place. I wouldn't find my running start. I didn't wanna go from 2010, retire, 2014, or 2013, say, I'm coming out of retirement, I wanna go for another games. I never wanted that to be me.
Starting point is 02:53:32
I said, as soon as I retired, I really, really wanna walk away because I'm doing something else. And I wanna win at something else. It's completely unrelated to speed skating. It's unrelated to the Olympic space. So it's almost like a chip on your shoulder. Not everyone is like that, but that was my perspective. And a lot of athletes, when they retire, literally like at the snap of a finger, when they
Starting point is 02:53:54
come home from the Olympic Games, there's no coach. There's no training program. There's no cafeteria. There's no there's no more structure and schedule that has been kind of given to you in a way that's pretty easy to follow. You just, you wake up, you go to the ice rink, you train, you come home, you eat, you focus on skating tapes, sharpen your skates, go back to the ice rink, train again, ecstatic set it. It's very mundane, but specific, but pretty easy to follow. It's simple.
Starting point is 02:54:21
I'd say not easy, it's simple. That's a great point, right? There's a big differentiation between simple and easy. There's nothing easy about it, but there's a beauty to being able to focus on one thing at the exclusion of pretty much everything else. Yeah. And now you wake up and, man, what do I do? Like, how important is money? How important is having a family? How important are relationships, how important is personal self development, how important is my nutrition, do I even understand nutrition?
Starting point is 02:54:48
Everyone, my nutrition is gaming the food to eat. Do I go for runs, do I work out? So I see a lot of athletes, because they're much effort. But around preparing athletes for that transition and retirement. There used to be, I don't know what it's like now. I think there's probably more of an emphasis now,
Starting point is 02:55:03
but they always, look, people always tell you, look, your Olympic career will end at some point, and you have to be prepared for the transition. We used to do these things called USOC summits, in which two years before the Olympics, you would go to a winter destination. For example, we would go to Park City, And then all the Olympic hopefuls and existing Olympic athletes in the past, two or three generations would come. Eric Hyde would be there, Bonnie Blair would be there, Dan Jansen would be there, Michelle Kwan, these people would be there.
Starting point is 02:55:35
And you basically would talk about what it takes to train for the next two years and then what to do before, during and after the Olympics. The issue is no one really takes it seriously because you have this invincibility complex that, you know what, I'm not gonna get hurt. Sure, I'm just gonna keep skating until I die. And I was naive enough, remember, I made some bad decisions as an athlete. I told you pretty early.
Starting point is 02:55:59
I was asked at the age of 17 at one of these summits, two years before the games. It said, like, a poll like, what do you want to be remembered for? And I wrote down, like, I want to be the most decorated, winter Olympic athlete of all time, the greatest speed skater who I've ever lived in short track speed skating.
Starting point is 02:56:13
And they put that in a Steiner ice arena in Utah. I forgot about this. But the things that I learned there were so important, but people could tell me all the time, and someone asked me, like, what do you want to do in your tire? I was like, what do you mean when I retire? Like, I was built for this sport. I'm supposed to be here
Starting point is 02:56:26
to motivate other human beings throughout my actions on the ice. It's very naive to say. And I, for some reason, I just thought that it was okay to live that life. It was like, I didn't have a parachute. I live that way in speed skating. On one side, it's beautiful because there is no plan B. And when there's no plan B, you really commit to plan A. You better make sure that plan A is going to be executed. That's the burning of the ships, right? Yeah. Yeah, you burn the ships so you can't leave the island. But again, there's still something here.
Starting point is 02:56:53
There's a difference, right, between people who seem to get more out of the sport. It's almost like they're actively versus passively participating in the process, right? The, you can very passively participate, I suspect, where you follow the lessons and you go through the motions of doing everything you need to do for the sport, versus I think a more active way of doing that. And I say active in an emotional way, not a physical way. Obviously, both examples are physically active,
Starting point is 02:57:22
but to be emotionally active through that process, I suspect you are, whether consciously or subconsciously, assimilating the knowledge, the skill, the failure, the discipline into what could be the next chapter. So let's go back and finish, how does the story end? It's 08, it's 09. So 09 is really the last major competition before the Olympics, right? It's the world's. Several championships. They're being held in Beijing and I'm competing. And there's one other US short track athlete who was my junior.
Starting point is 02:58:00
He started speed skating because he watched me in 2002. Now we're competing on the same team. He's from the same area I grew up in. I used to be his idol. And I always used to look at this kid and be like, this kid's a lot better than he actually realizes. Once he realizes how good he is, he's potentially going to be World Champion
Starting point is 02:58:17
or Olympic gold medalist. And throughout this process at the World Championships, I just performed sub optimally. I wasn't a major contender. I wasn't a top tier guy to win. I wasn't on top of the podium. I think I got like fifth at the world. At the world in 2009.
Starting point is 02:58:36
Yep, I gotta go back and check. And it was the first time I watched from the, after the competition, we had the banquet. Although athletes are there, everyone's getting awarded, you go in the podium, getting your checks, and it was the first time in a long time that I wasn't, didn't have the spotlight. I wasn't the guy that people were talking,
Starting point is 02:58:54
man, that race, all that pass. Oh my God, so powerful. Like, it was not about me, and I was like, oh man, this is, this is weird. Is this what it's supposed to be like? Do I just start to dissipate and just kind of wither away? And I used to be good and I'm still respected, but just don't have what it takes anymore to be competitive.
Starting point is 02:59:13
And I'm kind of losing that edge. And I can't keep up with the evolution of what's happening in short track because the body types are changing and the training is changing, the athletes are changing. And so I left there really, really, really worried and upset and also hearing that chatter again about, I don't think that Paulo's gonna be actually
Starting point is 02:59:31
on the podium in 2010, which is a big different conversation. I've been at that level for 10 years now at the top, top, top of my game. In the year 2000, 2001 season, I won every single race that season. And both the Korean athlete who I had that tussle with top of my game. In the year 2000, 2001 season, I won every single race that season. And both the Korean athlete who I had that tussle with and that Mark Gang-Yo character from Quebec, both camped me during that race and was like, you are the greatest athlete to compete in
Starting point is 02:59:54
short-treks, like two champions that I look up to and analyze said that to me, to now being at a point where no one was talking about. You're not even on the podium. I'm not even on the podium, but not only that people aren't even taking my lap times during practice anymore. So this is psychologically damaging because from a confidence perspective, you raised differently and I started to recognize that other athletes aren't respected me on the ice the same way they used to. I used to be able to actually have an off day, but if I just kind of attempted to pass
Starting point is 03:00:20
it, someone they just let me in because there was so much respect for what I had done in the sport before, that no longer existed. People skated as if I was just like a random skater. So this huge psychological advantage you brought to the start line was gone. It was gone. And so it really made me dive deep and say,
Starting point is 03:00:37
okay, like, look, this is my last chance at really trying to show up differently. And I think that, you know, my Korean coaches that I've been telling me, they're like, look, the Korean coaches themselves, they know you so well. They studied you from 2002 until today. You're the only thing that mattered to them.
Starting point is 03:00:57
So like they watched every single race you've ever skated time and time again. And they have pawns in their skating rinks to basically mimic your skating, just like a boxing like your sparring partner. So they have guys who try to mimic the way that you skate in that style. So they can practice against you every single day. We didn't have that. We didn't think about it like that. They were different level. And so I went back to my house in Utah and I said, man, I'm going to go back to kind of where I developed my strength and I said, I'm going to go spend a summer in Colorado Springs
Starting point is 03:01:31
alone. I drove there. Was there some part that thought maybe I should just retire? Because it's one thing to go through what you went through. It would be entirely another thing to fail on the Olympic stage. Yeah, I didn't want to give up. That's for sure. I still believed. This is interesting.
Starting point is 03:01:46
I mean, let's explore that for a moment because I got to be honest with you, man. I don't know that I would have had the intestinal fortitude to continue. If I really felt like I'm on the decline and every day I'm getting a little less good and everybody around me is getting a little bit better, I don't know, maybe that's why I'm not Olympic champion.
Starting point is 03:02:03
Like I mean, that's kind of a remarkable inner confidence. And did you explicitly or implicitly tie that back to some of these other difficult things you'd been through, including getting thrown out in the woods when you were in the summer of 98 and things like that? I did, but you know, again, you're... Like did you talk about this with your dad? I mean, who would?
Starting point is 03:02:24
I did, I did, extensively. He was my confidant. And there's three people in my life who were my confidant. He was my dad, one of my best friends, Ian Baranski, who was basically living in my house in Utah, as a training partner. And then John Schaefer, the guy who I brought in to live and train me during that period of time.
Starting point is 03:02:38
Those are the three people who I really, really had conversations with. John is the most optimistic, positive person on the planet. Like, there's nothing he believes that can't be accomplished through strength and focus. And so his thought was, oh, it doesn't matter. You're gonna come back and you're gonna crush everybody. You're gonna smash everybody.
Starting point is 03:02:52
You're gonna skate lap times it don't exist, you know? My dad's more realist. Ian is a very, very, very strong, different view. He's much more of a realist. And, you know, he saw- So what was the view between the three of them? My dad didn't really have an opinion, right? He's more just like, look, I support what you either do to make sure you, you really go
Starting point is 03:03:08
through the drawing board and develop a plan. And that was a different person than somebody I was, I think who's happy to see me, but he also recognized that it was not going to be easy. John, at the time, was like, well, you know, I think this is still possible. You can still win every single distance in the world. And you won't lose in the big year, you know, that's his attitude, which I needed to have that around because I'm not naturally that type of person. And then Ian was saying,
Starting point is 03:03:29
meaning you naturally don't have that much confidence? I have confidence, but it's different. Like I definitely, it's not like I walk in and say, I can't lose. There was times, right? When my equipment was on point, like earlier in my career, I was like, I could fall down, I guess I'll win this race.
Starting point is 03:03:40
Like no one's gonna beat me. I'm just that much better than everybody else. But at this point, you know, I was battling some small injuries and some equipment issues, and nothing was quite right. So I never felt like I was 100%, maybe 80% at times. So the one person I felt like really knew me was my friend Ian Baranski.
Starting point is 03:03:54
Now, to give you kinds of backstreet, as a short track on book athlete, you never show your cards, even to your teammates. Because eventually you raise against them the Olympic trials. So you kind of show that you always hold something back. And so I was really, really good at that. So people didn't really know what was going on internally. They just thought that I was like the stoic,
Starting point is 03:04:13
never show pain, incredibly focused, super hungry, quiet, kind of crazy guy who just comes to the rank with an insatiable appetite for pain and training every day, like with like a complete robot.. That's who Apollo is. And that's what I wanted the people to believe, right? The reality was, and I needed somebody to kind of provide in. It was Ian, my close friend. And, you know, Ian was my first roommate when I was traveling on all these years, like when I was 12 and 13 years old. So he knew me from when I started till to this point. And he basically was like,
Starting point is 03:04:45
look, you are not the same athlete you used to be. Like you're actually, even though you have the same recipe for success, you're just not the same. You're older, man, like your body's stiffer. You don't skate the same. You don't look the same. Your equipment's a little bit different. The other athletes are changing. The sport is changing. And you know, he's keeping it real, right? Someone has to. And so I kind of went back and I'm like, man, like, how do I, in my view, like all these years spent training, still only matters on this one day in the Olympics. Like, none of this stuff matters. My previous wins in my own head. My previous wins don't matter. I keep my medals inside my sock drawer
Starting point is 03:05:20
in my house. I never bring them out. I don't want to think about that I want. I want to think about I'm the underdog every day. So I said, I got to make some huge, huge changes. And so I, a week after the World Championships, I'm back in Salt Lake City. And normally you take like a decompression period and you really, really think about things. And I was gonna stay there for about a month
Starting point is 03:05:38
and then potentially go somewhere off the train. I just packed my bags like one day and I just left. And I drove all the way to Colorado Springs, checked myself into the Colorado Springs Olympic training center and began training. So the Olympic team moved from Colorado Springs to Salt Lake City in 2007 to train. So the Speed skaters were no longer in Colorado Springs Olympic training center. So when I arrived back there in 2009, I was the only guy there. Everyone else was off training in Utah or wherever else. And I brought my bike and I basically set up a little training plan. I just trained solo.
Starting point is 03:06:10
And this is like February, March of 2009. Yeah, this is like February, March, April, May. I think I first saw the team again, like the end of May. And I spent that entire time in like essentially complete solitude, just training by myself. And I just, you know, I, you know, just like anything else, you analyze the situation, what are the goals, what are you trying to do, what type of training you need. And mine wasn't based solely on sports science
Starting point is 03:06:34
because I didn't seek that route, I probably should have, but I didn't seek that route. I just like, okay, got to improve cadence, got to lower the body weight, maintain strength, but really have to just get an incredible aerobic base shape like you've never been before. And that's going to carry you throughout the rest of the year so that you won't have issues with burnout or, you know, with any overtraining.
Starting point is 03:06:52
And do you develop that aerobic base on the bike or on the track more? Well, we don't skate in the summer that much. We don't skate till the end of May. So that period off. So it's on a bike. It's on a bike. It's on inline skates. It's running. It's with treadmill. it's on a bike. It's on a bike, it's on in-line skates, it's running,
Starting point is 03:07:05
it's with treadmill, it's with stairmaster, but it's really spent a lot of time. For me, I used the Matatue incline in Colorado Springs, which is like the scar on the road, it's one mile of cog railroads steps to go up. And that was my sanctuary. Like I lived on that thing so many times a week. I used to go up it with weight vests and jumps and, you know,
Starting point is 03:07:26
you can't beat that thing. It's just one of those elements where you just get a little bit fast-radded and you get easier to compensate, but you hurt just the same. No matter how fast or slow you go. And so- What's the fastest time you could make it up that? Mine was like 1736 or 1738, which is fast.
Starting point is 03:07:41
Oh, and I think it's- Obviously lots of athletes do this, right? Does not just the skaters. Yeah, a lot of athletes. I would say the average time is probably 22, 24, between there. And that 17 and a half minutes was not with the 40 pound weight vest I assume.
Starting point is 03:07:53
No, no, no, it was clean. I needed to go back to that space again of like, this is where I started. How much of that training do you think was for your brain versus your body? 90%, 95%. I was probably doing everything wrong to be completely honest with you.
Starting point is 03:08:08
There's no reason why I should be going for three hour bike ride. My race has lasted no more than two and a half minutes. And of those two and a half minutes, I'm probably only really skating for a minute and a half. Three and a half hour bike rides going up and down like the canyons, they're important. Maybe you go a couple of those rides,
Starting point is 03:08:21
but you don't need that. I should be doing specified interval training according to the time that's under duration. And you can extend that, but I shouldn't be spinning my wheels for hours at a time. But what did I gain? A mental perspective and a honed focus and a resiliency and the feeling that I was reinventing myself was really important to me psychologically. So I would walk on the ice differently. I would walk into the ice ring differently.
Starting point is 03:08:48
I would project a different type of energy upon my opponents and other skaters and my conference level would be higher. So that's what I went after. And it wasn't until I came back to Salt Lake City and invited John Schaefer back into my home until he said, look, no more of these two hour runs. Like, what are you doing?
Starting point is 03:09:06
This is like so 1960, like, you're wasting your time and you're actually training the sprint out of your body, which is your biggest strength. And then I kind of explained to him my goals and we began that journey towards shedding all that weight and it was excruciating. And so how the story ends is arrive in Vancouver BC, 2010. And going into the Olympic trials, had you gotten back in enough shape that most people felt like you'd make the team?
Starting point is 03:09:30
Yeah, everyone knew I'd make the team. It wouldn't be as dominant as I normally would be, but for sure I'd make the team. So that's a big improvement over where you were at the worlds earlier in the year. Yeah, I think so. It definitely came a long way. And technically I had improved a lot
Starting point is 03:09:42
and people had seen some big changes in my body. And going into Vancouver, you've already figured out, like, this is your last Olympics. Internally, it didn't tell you about it, but internally. I've always wondered what it felt like for multiple Olympians, like, you know, when Phelps rolled into Rio. How bitter sweet it is in a way, because they, I don't know, like, do they appreciate it more than or the first time? Because you'd think, well, the first taste of this is the greatest. But perhaps in some, like, I'll give you another example.
Starting point is 03:10:12
It's totally unrelated. Like, I have three kids, right? And you've met them all. And I remember when the first one's born, I'm thinking, this is the greatest thing in the world. And now our third one, you kind of know, it's your last one. In some ways, I think I'm actually enjoying it even more. Like, changing the diaper is like,
Starting point is 03:10:30
you know what, there's gonna be a day when I don't get to do this anymore. And so, did you have that sort of feeling when you walked into the opening ceremony? One, you're being probably looked at now as the leader of the team, right? You're certainly one of the leaders of the team, just from a maturity standpoint and experience standpoint. And you also know inside, like, hey, I don't get
Starting point is 03:10:49
to put this uniform on and walk into this opening ceremony again. This is really the last hurrah for this chapter in my life. It's an absolute greater sense of appreciation for what you're doing. And also that you know that this is this is it. And I'm older, more mature, I can appreciate the process that I've been through. I've got scars, I've got wins and losses. Mentally you've gone through a lot. You spend a lot of time alone,
Starting point is 03:11:15
so you've battled your own internal insecurities and demons and self-doubt. So now you're the place where you feel like you've experienced a lot. So to me, the last games was the best. For sure, when the first Olympics was incredible, never taken away, but I was so young, difficult to absorb that type of information at that rate of speed, which you've never had access to before.
Starting point is 03:11:35
2006, different environment, different games, been through it one time, understand it. I know how to do this. I know how to handle the pressure. I know what the sounds are like. Go through the process. The last one, you go walk into the arena, you hear the sounds and it sounds awesome. Just you have a greater sense of appreciation.
Starting point is 03:11:54
And also you're just really focused on just trying to be your absolute best. So it's not like you're there to experience the moment because you just don't have time to, right? You're there for a specific task and a goal. And unfortunately that detracts away from your time to be present and experience the Olympic Games for what we see them as. It's an amazing production of the world coming together to compete.
Starting point is 03:12:16
We go there and it's just like, I'm ice rink, Olympic Village, ice rink, Olympic Village, ice rink, Olympic Village, rest, recovery, massage, sharpened skates, game time. That's a recipe right there. Yeah, in many ways you do as a spectator even feel bad for the favorites because it's a totally different experience in swimming, for example, like usually the meat kicks off with the 400 I am.
Starting point is 03:12:38
And so if you're a favorite to win the 400 I am, I'm not even sure if you're showing up to the opening ceremonies. You're not. You're absolutely not. Yeah, I mean, it's like, whereas if you're not a favorite, if you're not even gonna make it out of the first heat, you're gonna go to the opening ceremonies
Starting point is 03:12:50
because that is part of, like, that is the experience, right? If you're gonna open ceremonies, you're gonna have a drink. Yeah. So it's important to keep in mind, like, the sacrifice that has to be made if you really want to win, using that very specific example. It's a moment in time, right? So as much as you wanna have fun and go talk to their athletes
Starting point is 03:13:07
and mingle with the different cultures and community, you've trained your entire life for these two weeks and you are not going to allow one slip-up to detract away from that in these two weeks. And it's funny because when you're four years away from a game, it's like when it's 2006, oh man, I'm four years away. This is going to take forever. You know, like this is, yeah, and I know I hear when it says it's going to be here before I know it. And then two weeks
Starting point is 03:13:34
during those games, you're like, man, I wish I had another year of training. You know, I'm saying that in 2006, you know, you're wishing like the games were in a year or two. And so it's a different perspective. But I arrived and I hit my goal set in terms of my weight, my cadence. And the first check mark for me was when I got on the ice in Vancouver and the Chinese coaches are there, the Canadian coaches are there, the Russian coaches are there, all the coaches from the different teams are there
Starting point is 03:13:57
and they're videotaping our practice. As they are, everyone else is practice because the first look at seeing which shape your entity change anything since the last World Cup, there's your body weight different, are your equipment different, what are you doing differently? And the first thing that we heard via the chatter that was going on was like, we don't even recognize Apollo.
Starting point is 03:14:15
This guy we trained to beat. He didn't show up. We got a new guy. A new guy. A new guy with a new cadence, a new rhythm, a new style of training, a new style of racing, a new tech, everything was different. That's exactly what we wanted to do and had an incredible team to help support that, not only my strength coach John Chavir, but the rest of the Olympic team.
Starting point is 03:14:33
And my teammates too were a huge part of that, right? Because we trained every single day together. And it's a really, really powerful feeling to be able to show up. And like to me, that was the win, actually. It was before I had a race that was like, man, like I went through this, I took a huge gamble and I wasn't sure if it was going to work. I think it did. I feel like it did. Everyone else is saying like it, my coaches are beyond happy and they can't believe what we just accomplished and I haven't raced the race yet. That's a very powerful feeling to go into your first race with. And then from there,
Starting point is 03:15:04
it's like, look, I've done the work. There's nothing more I could have done. I wouldn't change anything. And it's time to just focus on strategy and compete. And then I add up winning another three medal at those games and retiring with eight medals. Were you sad or happy at the closing ceremonies? Was that... It was both.
Starting point is 03:15:22
I was both sad and happy. I couldn't believe that my life had turned into this direction. I couldn't believe that I'd spent this much time dedicated towards a sport. I couldn't believe the amount of press and interest that we were getting from a crazy sport, like short track speed skating and just feeling grateful. And then also kind of promising myself that like,
Starting point is 03:15:41
hey, like any opportunity that comes your way, you are going to say yes, no matter what, for the next year. And then thus began when I walked off the plane from Vancouver, I like, wasn't in one place for more than two or three days, just bouncing around from speaking engagement to appearance, to meeting, to sponsor play stuff. It was incredible. Were your sponsors by the end of the 2000 Olympics who were your main sponsors.
Starting point is 03:16:07
I had Alaska Airlines, we had Omega. Subway was still. Subway was yes that year. Coca-Cola was a sponsor. There's a few others, but those are the major sponsors. And when did you announce your retirement? I announced my retirement in 2012 publicly, but I knew, I knew in 2009, this was my last games.
Starting point is 03:16:26
It was just one of those things where I was happy and I really wanted to complete the game. I always talk about that, right? But I never wanted to come back. I never wanted to finish my career feeling like I was missing something. I had an itch, I didn't want to be going down the line, working on a new app, and be like, man,
Starting point is 03:16:44
I think I'm gonna come up out of retirement. And I had that feeling watching Phelps in 2012 during the London Olympics. You had that feeling for him or yourself? For myself to wonder like, man, I'm still in great shape. I still feel really healthy. I know a lot more about myself, nutrition, technique, training than I ever did. I'm pretty sure I can make this team, and I'm pretty sure I can be competitive in the Sochi Olympics in two years. And then so instead of that, I had that conversation with myself internally while doing commentary in NBC Olympic Games, while interviewing Phelps
Starting point is 03:17:15
at his first press conference and talking to him about the pressures of being so successful, how does he maintain, you know, like his sense of... In 2012 was a very difficult Olympics for Michael. I mean, I don't know him, of course, but I just, I know enough about swimming to be able to watch and read between the lines. But... He went through a lot. There's only two events he entered in the Olympics where he didn't win a medal. The first was that fifth place finish in the 200 fly as a 15-year-old boy in 2000 in
Starting point is 03:17:39
Sydney. But what a lot of people forget is he finished fourth in the 400 IM, his signature event in London. And that's a race that if I recall, I mean, at the time, Lockty was probably the best 400 IMer in the world, but Michael had done really well in the trials and basically touched out another swimmer that most people thought was going to get that spot. But then kind of faded at the back of the 400 IM. Didn't look like I'm self-final. No, didn't at all.
Starting point is 03:18:06
And I've always thought sort of inside baseball, minutia. If I were to say like as a swim fan what were the greatest felps performances of all time, I'll tell you what is number one. His anchoring the four by 100 relay right after his abysmal performance. And I use abysmal in quotes, but for Phelps, his abysmal performance in the 400 I am. And I remember watching that race thinking, oh my god, this could shatter his confidence for the rest of the meat. And then he shows up in the next race, the four by 100 free relay, and crushes the anchor, Crush is the lead off leg.
Starting point is 03:18:47
There's a backstory to what happened in the anchor of that and they didn't end up winning the gold, but that was one of his most remarkable performances. But overall, that Olympics was sort of sad for me to watch films because I felt like, God, like he's not the same swimmer he was. He got outtouched in the 200 fly and all these other things. So what was that
Starting point is 03:19:05
like for you both talking to him about it, but also just now thinking, wait a minute, should I be doing this again? You're going through this process of what you didn't want to do. I didn't want to do that. And I was having that conversation. And then, you know, I had some friends who they always thought that I retired too early. They were like, man, you still got another four years. Because you were what, 29 at this point? It's 28, yeah. What do you mean? I was young.
Starting point is 03:19:30
By the way, looking at Michael and seeing him, by the way, in that race, directed anger and rage is very powerful. And Michael swims very well when he's angry, very well. And he needs to have- So you saw that between the 400 IM and the 4x1. Because I was very similar. I needed to have, like if I was winning too often,
Starting point is 03:19:53
like I needed to throw in a little self sabotage, little monkey wrench in there to lose a race and then get that feeling of losing and like, oh, I forgot what that tasted like. I think Michael won so easy for so long. It's difficult to push yourself when no one else is. It's only you out there, and you can win if you're 70%. Right?
Starting point is 03:20:14
And he's so incredibly talented. That's what I saw. And maybe that's wrong, but that's my view. And so when I was watching that, and I said, I'm not gonna make a decision here. So I came back home, I went to that same place, moclips in Iron Springs Resort. And I said, I'm going to really think about this and make a real decision on whether I want to do.
Starting point is 03:20:31
And I said, you know what? I'm not going to go back. I'm going to continue on this path of trying to become an entrepreneur and trying to learn and explore and grow as a human. And that's what I'm going to commit to. And I'm not going to listen to this short-sighted wants of wanting to relive in those Olympic moments again. Because I think a lot of that's what it comes from.
Starting point is 03:20:53
It's like, you know, two years out from the games, although I'm there, I'm on the other side of the lens for the first time ever and it's a different feeling. And I want to be the guy on the start line in that fourth and fifth lane, getting ready to go. I want to be one of the favorites to win this race. And I want that pressure. I want that moment of, okay, the curtains open. It's a do or die. Like you either perform or you don't, the paper is never going to lie at the end of the day. And you don't
Starting point is 03:21:20
get that anymore. You do, if you have a different perspective in terms of business and opportunities, but as athletes, it feels different. It doesn't matter how, which way you chop it up. So I'm glad I made the right decision. I decided not to go back to the sport and I was gonna pursue different opportunities and different things in my life. And that was the decision I made.
Starting point is 03:21:37
And I'm still happy about doing that. God, it's such an amazing journey because I've known quite a bit about you before we spoke today, but I didn't realize I think all of the internal struggle. I think it's just so easy to kind of look at athletes and look at the ones who have done so well and assume that it was always clear in their mind that they were going to win and they just executed and you don't realize the best athletes are still humans, which means they still come with all the doubts that the rest of us have and the self-loathing and the shame or the... In some ways, perhaps even perverse incentives.
Starting point is 03:22:10
I can't help but hear your story and wonder how much of this was sort of you needing to prove yourself to someone, to something. From the moment we talked about, you know, your mom, not being there, I've always wondered is like, is there something about you wanting to demonstrate to her like, hey, I'm worth it. I was, you know, I've always wondered is like, is there something about you wanting to demonstrate to her, like, hey, I'm worth it. Like, I was, you know, I was an amazing kid and that maybe too obvious a statement, right? Maybe that, maybe that never even factored into any of this stuff subconsciously, but you were a very driven kid from the beginning.
Starting point is 03:22:37
I describe, these are like missiles without guidance systems. Those are still good things to have. Like, it's great to be a missile that just needs a guidance system. When you think now, where do you want to be in 10 years? Obviously, it's going to be mostly business related. I think we were talking about it over dinner. It's not like you necessarily want to go back to coaching, skating or something, which is unfortunate, because I think in many ways,
Starting point is 03:23:00
you could bring so much to that sport. If unfortunate for the sport, not for you, that you could bring so much to that sport. If unfortunate for the sport, not for you, that you could bring so much knowledge, as you've said, your knowledge of nutrition and training and specificity today is so much beyond what you had at the time. But let's just pause it for a moment that you're not going to become the head coach
Starting point is 03:23:17
of the US speed skating team. Where do you want to be in 10 years? 10 years, I want to be, I think, first and foremost, healthy. I want to have increased my personal relationships with my close family and friends, made new ones along the way, increased the amount of experiences that we've shared together. Business, I think that I'll always have an urge to be involved in different projects and different ideas and whether they succeed or fail. I want to win but I don't think it's necessarily that's the the real importance is that I go through those processes and hopefully I learn and apply those lessons at the next business opportunity or the next venture
Starting point is 03:23:57
or path that I'm doing and I think at least my father told me at one point, he's like, you know, Paul, in your mid thirties into your early forties, you will become significantly more self reflective and inquisitive of many questions. My father's a very curious person as am I. And so like these questions come up in my life that I never asked when I was an athlete, like, what is really important? What do I really care about? We were talking about like watches and these things that have like limitless acquisition opportunity.
Starting point is 03:24:32
Where does some of these things really play a role in my life in the long term? And what do I really need that really makes me happy? And, you know, I feel really blessed to have had both incredible wins in my life, both on the field of play and off the field of play. And also I'm really blessed to have had both incredible wins in my life, both on the field of play and off the field of play. And also, I'm really blessed and have gratitude for the incredible stupid mistakes that I've
Starting point is 03:24:52
made and losses that I've created both on and off the field of play, either through business and relationships, the way that I act at or whatever. I am human like anyone else. I've developed superhuman like attributes associated with this sport as with anyone who dedicated a lifetime of achievement towards something. Maybe they wouldn't be Olympic champion, maybe they would be very, very good at that thing. And I think that I've just, I've realized that the things that make me really happy, it's pretty small list. And I feel really, really grateful and happy to have recognized that at the age of 36.
Starting point is 03:25:28
And I want to continue that. And I want to continue to explore, I want to continue to learn. And hopefully I can give back and teach the next generation of kids and people, whether they want to be an athlete or not, I believe that everyone should be playing sports in some capacity. Regardless of your output or your skill set, I believe that everyone should be playing sports in some capacity, regardless of your output or your skill set, I think there's amazing life lessons that are learned about how to win, how to lose,
Starting point is 03:25:51
and just like I went through about committing and dedicating and sacrificing and going through the physical pains that you have to go through, I think there's really powerful things. Even if you just suck and you're the last guy picked, it doesn't really matter. There's things that you learn through that process. I think they're difficult to teach
Starting point is 03:26:06
if you don't have the physical component that's associated. And so I think about that often, as I, every year that goes by, I'm eight years retired now from the sport or short-track speed skating. I have no desire to go back. I love going to every Olympic Games and commentating.
Starting point is 03:26:22
I feel at my element. It's a homecoming and reunion for me to see all my old friends and associates and I keep tabs in the race. And sometimes I watch speed skating tapes until 4.30 in the morning and realize, like, dude, this doesn't matter anymore. Like, put it away, you know?
Starting point is 03:26:37
And then also just trying to find out and understand more about myself. And I think that's really interesting. And so, you know, I've gained a lot from just spending time and learning from people who I don't consider to be, if you ask me, younger, when I was younger, experts in their field. But now I've had a much more open mind.
Starting point is 03:26:57
I've learned a lot from you. I've learned a lot from a lot of the people that you are friends with, a lot of these even podcasts, and the advent of technology and access to information is so incredible. You know, when I went on my personal big games, we didn't have Instagram. Like people were barely using their phones
Starting point is 03:27:13
in the same degree that we were doing today. So like your access to the internet was just a Google a couple of ideas, but that's pretty the bare minimum. If you're creating content, you are one of the very few, right? And so I think it's really interesting and I've been traveling around the world. Yeah. Your travel schedule is worse than mine. And I tend to lament my travel schedule. But yeah, yours is, I mean, you're really never in the same place for more than two or three weeks, right? Yeah. This is probably the longest I've been in one place in the US in actually
Starting point is 03:27:41
in years. So I'm actually really enjoying it. I've been spending a lot of my time, but 80% of my time in Asia, and my routine is pretty aggressive. I've always had a fascination with Asia in general, both the food, the culture, the people, the diversity, the growth, the opportunities that exist there. But you still don't speak Japanese fluently? No, I know.
Starting point is 03:28:00
I know. I speak Japanese fluently. I speak more Korean than I do Japanese, and I think this is a byproduct of me being around. I just have to introduce you to Tim Ferris because he will be able to teach you Japanese in a shorter period of time than I'm convinced anybody could teach you. That's right. That's his amazing ability to deconstruct world-class people. Japanese was the first language he learned outside of English because he went and spent
Starting point is 03:28:20
a year in Japan when he was in high school. And I remember one night over dinner, he just explained to me how he learned the language. Cause, you know, if someone says to me, look, I went to live in France for a year and I learned French. I'm like, okay, well, I get that. Like that strikes me as achievable, right? Or, you know, I got to spend a year in Mexico
Starting point is 03:28:37
and I learned Spanish. Okay, I get that. I can relate to that. But, you know, you take a white kid out of Long Island and send him to Japan for a year and he comes back speaking obviously with an accent but very fluent Japanese. That's incredible. And he, you know, he can really articulate that process.
Starting point is 03:28:55
So I don't know, we might have to make that happen. Yeah. Sure, it would make your dad pretty happy, right? It would make him very happy. My dad still counts in his head in Japanese. So as much as he wants to be full on American, as he is American, but you know, he still can't shake that.
Starting point is 03:29:10
And I know they're waiting for us inside. So I guess we should continue this discussion off the mic. But I want to thank you so much for everything for coming down. And also just for being so generous with your insights as well. I know we've, I'm guessing that a lot of what we talked about today You've talked about a thousand times before and it's sort of like God
Starting point is 03:29:28
Do I have to tell that story all over again? But but I think we've also talked about a bunch of things that certainly I've never heard before and maybe that means that for others there's also more of a collection of stuff here Last question I have for you though is thinking about your race and career You you talked a lot at the outside about your father and stilling this belief in you that there should always be this pursuit of perfection, even if you never get there. Is there a race when you look back at your career that was the narrowest gap between what you perceived to be the perfect race and your actual outcome? Not necessarily the place you stood on the podium, but just in terms of your execution.
Starting point is 03:30:03
Yeah, there's one race that I publicly talk about as being the quasi-perfect race. And it was the 500 meters in Torino Italy. I was not favored to win that race. I hadn't won that race all year long. I hadn't won a gold yet in those Olympics. It was clear that the South Korean team was just better at those games.
Starting point is 03:30:22
And I was in the final, and I had incredible athletes to skate against, and I knew my only option was to basically, we call it jamming the pack, where you slow down so that people can't get their momentum to pass you. Right, so if you can imagine driving a Honda on a freeway and a Ferrari is behind you, imagine the Honda, wherever the Ferrari goes, the Honda is in that lane. So it doesn't matter how fast the Ferrari is behind you. Imagine the Honda, wherever the Ferrari goes, the Honda is in that lane. So it doesn't matter how fast the Ferrari is,
Starting point is 03:30:49
he can't pass because he's blocked by that car. That was the strategy that I'd use in that race. I wasn't the fastest, I wasn't the best, I wasn't the most likely to win, and I was able to pull off a wire to wire win. So that was, publicly that was one of the races that I think that was the most perfect for me because everything was in the line. I wanted to win. Everyone had
Starting point is 03:31:07
kind of given up on my team. They thought that I wasn't going to win that race. My sports psychologist at the time basically said, I'm hollow, this is your second on the big game. It's amazing what you've gone through. Crazy that you came back and you won another couple of medals. You should be really proud of yourself. And I took that as like, are you giving up on me, man? Like, there's only one more race left. And so it was personally very, very powerful in this role. And then I've had a couple of other races where just execution wise, it was so perfect. Just the past being in that flow state,
Starting point is 03:31:36
everything felt very automatic and easy. It slowed down, the minute and a half long race felt like five minutes. I felt like I produced zero lactic acid in my body, and it felt like I just was simply significantly faster than everybody else. I felt like Neo from the Matrix, and I don't say that with any exaggeration,
Starting point is 03:31:54
it just felt so incredibly easy to maneuver and dance on my skates and pass that I was the puppet master. And those are the feelings that I think we, all of us are addicted to, whether you're a writer, whether you're a doctor, whether you are a singer, you have that one glimpse of being in a true state of flow. And it's so difficult to replicate. And you spend years, years searching for that one time,
Starting point is 03:32:25
and you do everything possible. You go back and you check, what did I eat that day? Well, I had three grapes in the morning. Well, you know what's gonna happen for the next two years? I got three grapes, and they're all green for the rest of my life, right? You just try to replicate, because you don't know what changed.
Starting point is 03:32:39
And I'm not sure we can really identify what that is, but those moments are the ones that I crave and I get into those moments no longer in sports. Sometimes I get it to where I'm in the gym, when I'm alone, that's my sanctuary, but in conversation, like our conversation, three and a half hours went by earlier and I had no idea,
Starting point is 03:32:58
because I was so transported into that moment. And to me, that feels perfect because you're present, you're here, you're here. The quality of time is being spent and hopefully people at home didn't fall asleep listening to my crazy speech again. I'm sure they didn't. I'm going to get you into race car driving because that is another example of where this flow thing happens. So your lap time on the track is like you'll focus on that. I mean, in many ways to me driving a race car is basically just a bunch of time trials. And I know it sounds like a cliche, but my absolute fastest laps in any car on any lap never
Starting point is 03:33:33
feel that fast. Yes. That is the most amazing feeling. Usually when I set a lap record, which is just meeting my lap record, like I'm never going to be the guy that sets the actual lap record, but my lap records are always after the fact I just noticed it. I'm like, wait, holy, you took like five tenths off your fastest time ever, and that felt effortless. That really is a beautiful feeling, isn't it?
Starting point is 03:33:59
It's an amazing thing. And you're right, it is so addictive. And I think that's part of why competitive sports have been displaced by things that I do, not necessarily competitively, but just competitive of myself, like archery and race car driving and these things, because you're waiting for that day when it's like,
Starting point is 03:34:15
oh my God, you did 12 out of 12 shots, all bulls eye. How did that happen? That's why people run, so people do iron men, and so people do triathlon, that's why people run, so people do Ironman, so people do triathlon, that's why people do everything. And I'm convinced that you have to care enough about the outcome for you to get in that state. There has to be some form of consequence, maybe that physical, maybe that danger, but psychologically to impact you, to almost force yourself into that realm. That's why I think athletes always time and time getting in that flow state more than anyone else,
Starting point is 03:34:44
as with the military and people who are in the service because they're in real true flow state because they will die if they're not. But I think that there's a lot to be said there. And I think that we as human beings take that for granted. I think athletes a lot of times take that for granted and trying to achieve that flow state of maintaining that mental consistency.
Starting point is 03:35:02
And that's what I was seeking for all those years. That's why I read all those books about sports psychology and the brain and human behavior and trying to understand myself and others. And it's a beautiful thing, yeah. So where can people find you on social media? Social, I'm Adapala Ono on Twitter. My Instagram is, you know, that for pictures,
Starting point is 03:35:19
but I'm not as active as I'd like to be. And it's something that I would like to restart. And what's your handle on Instagram is it the same? It's the same at Apollo. Any books that you recommend that you've, I know you've written a couple, any of those that you think people ought to follow up on based on what we've talked about today were,
Starting point is 03:35:33
because I know you have one called No Regrets, which basically describes kind of this, this ethos going into the 2010 games, right? Yeah, I mean, my book of, it was called Zero Regrets. I wrote that right after the Olympic Games. I had an amazing experience. Zero Regrets. Zero Regrets. Zero Regrets. But it's kind of like a snippet into my life. And also, you got to remember, I was in that mind frame of really just post-the-lumpet games without all these other experiences involved.
Starting point is 03:35:56
To be able to really think back objectively and think and remember and really understand what was happening at the time. But that was one of the books that I had written with a ghost writer. When I say I had written, I didn't actually write the book. I wish I was a great writer and had that talent. My writing skills are subpar. But I really enjoy reading and I really enjoy learning. And so I've, I mean, look, I've invested,
Starting point is 03:36:18
I've spent time into businesses and deals and things that are so far away from sports that would really blow people's minds. Because I just fascinated, right? I'm a curious learner. And it's been amazing opening the next chapter of the life and seeing where life takes me. Well, it's amazing to know that you're athletic career span, what, 12 years basically. Your professional career, your career is a father, whatever else you go on to do is going to span multiples of that. So in many ways, the best is yet to come, right? I believe so. I hope that's true for all of us. I think so.
