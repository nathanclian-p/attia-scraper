Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at peteratia-md.com.

Do a special bonus ask me anything episode and what we are likely to call celebrity AMA number one. In this and future celebrity AMA bonuses, instead of being asked questions by my head research analyst Bob Kaplan, I'll be asked questions by guests, either future guests, special guests or just other guests on the podcast. So for celebrity AMA one, I'm joined by Olympians Apollo Ono and Sasha Cohen. In this episode, we talk about fasting. We talk about the role of nutrition during periods of study, and this is prompted by something that Apollo is about to embark on. We talk about exercise,
Starting point is 00:01:16
the ultimate gorge or feast meal, and we talk about watches, which really, I think, was the question I struggled with the most. From there, Sasha takes takes over and she asks me about things that excite me the most in longevity. We talk about mTOR and RAPA MISIN, how to measure results when you're doing a lot of interventions, blood tests, and supplements, along with a few other things.

So without further delay, I hope you enjoy celebrity AMA number one. Mipala Ono 8 time on the big metalist spent about 15 years in my life previously pursuing the sport of short track speed skating and I have the pleasure of doing a AMA with Peter Atia, my good friend,

and I've got some interesting questions here and hopefully you haven't answered all of them before in the past. I try to do as much to do and just I could. I would love to expand upon some of these further. So thanks for having me on Peter to interview you. You're having me on so take it away man. Yeah let's jump right in. So my first question is centered around women and fasting. And to give it some context, my girlfriend, she has a very difficult time doing water only fasts. It gets dizzy, feels like she needs some sort of sugar, some kind of just anything, any type of caloric intake, and where I can do seven plus days, kind of no problem most of the time.
Starting point is 00:03:30
So what is the difference here, and is there a separate protocol that you've seen for maybe perhaps clients who are female? I have definitely noticed over the past few years that even when it comes to time restricted feeding, so not even getting to the point of a fast, but just saying, not eating for 18 hours a day, that there appears to be a gender difference.
Starting point is 00:03:49
I could sort of concoct a bunch of evolutionary answers that may or may not be true. Certainly, one of the ones I'll come back to if we have a moment is to talk about the impact of fasting on fertility in women. So my point being is, I definitely appreciate what you're saying, and we see it clinically with our patients. Now that said, I also have seen many female patients who can fast independent of body habitus because obviously
Starting point is 00:04:11
Beyond guy is tiny and maybe that plays a role, but I don't think that that's it because I think there there might be something else going on. So I think I don't know the answer, but what I would say is it might just mean that for some people they need more time to work up to a fast, which means longer stretches of time restricted feeding. And then what we would typically do is progress patients through something as follows. So once a person can pretty consistently go 18 hours with a six hour feeding window, you then move to one meal per day. Can she do one meal per day?
Starting point is 00:04:40
Absolutely. And in the afternoon, she feels totally fine. No problem. Okay. So then the next thing I typically try is a 36 hour fast where you'll do like dinner Monday, lunch breakfast, Wednesday, so you go a night and then a full day and then into the next day.
Starting point is 00:04:54
Is that something she's tried? Yeah, she can do the 48 hour fast. Anything past, I would say 72, really difficult for her. She just is not able to physically, basically can't leave the house. Is she experiencing lightheadedness, cramps? No cramps, but definitely lightheadedness, severe lack of energy, and just doesn't have the cognitive ability to do anything that would require semi-deep thought. Yeah, again, it's hard to know. I mean, does she check her glucose
Starting point is 00:05:21
and ketone levels all the way through this? No. Sometimes that provides a bit of an insight. You and I have talked about this a bunch, but I find going into ketosis the week before makes that transition a lot easier. So much easier. And I've sometimes done the exact opposite and gone right into a fast out of a bender. And that's, I mean, you'll pay the filler all day long.
Starting point is 00:05:41
The other thing that I think is important for everybody to understand is one, I'm glad to hear that when she feels that way she stops because I do think it's important for people to not hammer through fasts no matter what. You can quote unquote fail at a fast 99 times and come back on the hundredth and be successful and in my mind they're all successful. So so I think it's really important that people get it through their mind that hey if this isn't feeling right or going right I stop and I eat again. The second thing is a lot of people don't realize how much food contains water. So when you're not eating, you have to make up that water that you're not getting from
Starting point is 00:06:12
food in addition to what you think you normally would need to drink. So if you're a person who normally gets by sort of drinking, call it four liters of water, they say a gallon of water. You're going to need more than that for two reasons. The first is when you're fasting, your body is typically excreting sodium at a higher rate, so that's creating what's called a dioresis. So you have to compensate for that, and then you also have to compensate for the fact that you're not getting the water in the food. So that might be the other thing to think about. And the easiest way, I mean, there's some technical ways that one can sort
Starting point is 00:06:39
of measure the volume balance, but honestly, just looking at your end output is a great way to do it. I mean, when I'm fasting fasting one of the things I'm thinking about is how often am I going to the bathroom? If I don't get up to pee about every 90 minutes, I'm not drinking enough. Got it. That's great. The other thing by the way, is she a caffeine drinker normally? She's not. Okay, because that's the other thing that you always want to think about in people is sometimes when they stop caffeine as well The one-two punch of no food no no caffeine can be really devastating. And in those patients, I generally think it makes sense to probably allow them to continue to drink black coffee or high caffeine tea or whatever to sort of pick and choose your battle.
Starting point is 00:07:13
Okay. Thank you for that. Let's move to number two. So, my other question is, you have kids. So what are your thoughts on adolescent fasting? And is there a place for it routinely? I.e. do you think that in 20 years, it'll be a regular part, 50 years of a curriculum or a dietary program. So I'm talking mid-teen to late teen. Boy, that's an interesting question, and it really depends, I suspect, on the health of the
Starting point is 00:07:39
child. So there are probably certain situations where it could make sense. Unfortunately, today we're in kind of an epidemic of obesity type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease amongst kids and adolescents. And certainly in kids with metabolic conditions under the right supervision, I think one could make the case that some form of fasting, whether it be time restriction feeding or even hypochaloric periods of time, for example, several days at a time with an energy input that's below requirement could have enormous medical benefit. But at the same time, one has to be very careful about threading this needle because they're
Starting point is 00:08:16
still basically supposed to be in anabolic mode. A 14, 15, 16 year old adolescent is still growing. And so a lot of times, doctors who take care of kids that age that have obesity have a different goal, which is not weight loss per se, but actually weight stability. So let them grow into this weight. Now, that's a bit of a sort of hokey concept because as an athlete, you'll appreciate that weight is not really the issue. The issue is fat mass versus muscle mass. And in the end, what we're talking about is potentially a treatment for excessive fat mass. The other thing, of course, that has to be really considered is, I do believe, and I don't have great evidence
Starting point is 00:08:57
to suggest this. This is really based on discussions with endocrinologists, my own personal experience in interacting with patients that have had eating disorders. But I think there is a critical window during which deprivation of food can be potentially harmful. And I think that's why I've certainly seen a subset of people who have had disordered eating or eating disorders during adolescence. And it has sort of imprinted their endocrine system in a way that's come back to haunt them as an adult.
Starting point is 00:09:24
So kind of a long-winded answer, which is to say, I think we don't know the safety of that yet. My view is that unless you're an adult, really this isn't something that should be considered as a regular part of how you eat, but that's also acknowledging the fact that I know evolutionarily it's tolerated because obviously we came from our ancestors
Starting point is 00:09:43
who, whether they be children or adults, would have gone through periods of time with that food. So, yeah, I don't know. I think this should be studied though, because it's important and I wouldn't want to just speculate from, or extrapolate rather from adults. Okay. That's a long list, man.
Starting point is 00:09:57
That is a lot of questions I'm looking at over there, dude. You went whole hog on this. Holy cow. You took it seriously. And I apologize everyone who was listening. Some of these are selfishly because I just really want to know for myself. And speaking of that, I'm going back to school this fall.
Starting point is 00:10:11
And. Wait, I didn't know this. I did know this. Yeah, yeah, so I'm doing this program at Wharton this fall. OK, that's what I was asking you about, because I thought you were going to be in Philly this week. Yeah, basically in a couple weeks. Oh, all right.

So in lieu of that, what is your preferred diet for consuming large amounts of information retaining it while still being alert? Because the influx of information and critical thinking is going to be at an all-time high for me for approximately eight weeks straight.
