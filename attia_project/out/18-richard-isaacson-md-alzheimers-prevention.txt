Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find

more information on today's episode and other topics at pteratia-m-d.com. Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of the Peter Atia Drive. This week I have the privilege of interviewing a good friend, a collaborator, and an all-round interesting dude named Richard Isaacson. Richard is a neurologist who specializes in Alzheimer's disease. He is the director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Cornell here in New York City. His life has been touched by Alzheimer's disease and from a very early age, as Richard describes, he felt a calling to go into neurology. It is clearly his life's work. He's an absolute
Starting point is 00:01:15
expert in Alzheimer's disease, but specifically has chosen to focus his efforts on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease as opposed to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And actually, this puts him in the minority of neurologists. Professionally, as I said, he's an associate professor of neurology at Cornell, medical college here in the city. He's also an attending neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He grew up not too far from here in Long Island or thereabouts. And actually one of my favorite little tidbits I learned about him is he went to a high school called Connick High School
Starting point is 00:01:46
and he was recently named among the most distinguished alumni. So his photo now hangs alongside fellow recipients Rosie O'Donnell and Bob Costas. So that's pretty impressive. He's a little bit of a doogie housing started college at 17 finished medical school at 23 So as I think I point out in the podcast, he finished medical school before I actually started medical school. That is internship in Miami before ultimately doing his training at Beth Israel and Harvard. Ultimately, he has wound his way back to New York. And as we get into great detail in this podcast about what his work is, and I think more importantly, how it can help people listening to this or their loved ones.
Starting point is 00:02:26
And also I think we are very open about the limitations in this space and what we do and don't know. Richard has developed, and I should say Richard and his team, let's be honest, like all great people, they're sort of surrounded by a team of great people. They've developed something called ALZU, so it's www.alz letter u dot org, which might be one of the single most important resources for people with Alzheimer's disease or early cognitive impairment and their family members. So we'll obviously link to that very prominently, but I think that's something that will, if you take nothing else from this podcast, other than a sort of visit to alz.org, that would be terrific.
Starting point is 00:03:03
Richard and I get into a lot of stuff. I think this podcast probably runs about two and a half hours. And we talk at the initial part, by the way, we get into something that was not at all planned. But when Richard came over, I don't think in all the time I've known Richard, which has been about three and a half for four years, I didn't notice how much he was into like bling phones. And when he whipped his phone out, it just couldn't stop laughing. So the first like 10 minutes of this podcast are us talking about this ridiculous thing that I hope we have pictures of to link to in the show notes. Obviously the show notes are usually timestamped so you can skip past the patty cakes and get
Starting point is 00:03:37
to the meat of the discussion should you want. But that said, I can't highly enough recommend listening to Richard talk about his slot machine addiction and his funny phones. We talk about the ideology of Alzheimer's to the best of our ability to understand it. We talk about the incidence prevalence and the distinction between those two. We talk quite a bit about the distinction between men and women. As some of you may know, there seems to be a bias towards women getting Alzheimer's disease more commonly than men. And both Richard and I agree that that's probably not just an artifact of women living longer. There must be something else going on there. And we explore that topic. We go into great detail about what we believe the
Starting point is 00:04:18
state of the evidence is, which admittedly at this point is still relatively early about what steps people can take to reduce their risk of Alzheimer's disease. And we get really into the semantics of this. What is the difference between risk reduction and prevention? And we talk all about the politics of that and how those have changed. We give, when I say we, meaning I discuss with Richard and Richard gives a great overview and primer on ApoE. We've had a lot of questions on APOE and we've deliberately punted those from the AMA because I knew that this discussion with Richard was coming up. So for many of you to have questions about the APOE gene, I think you'll find that interesting.
Starting point is 00:04:56
And I'll tell you something that I learned even in this discussion was so much of the subtlety around other genes that are named and unnamed at this point or SNPs that we know about versus don't know about that also seem to be predisposing to Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, this is a disease that is going to touch pretty much everybody who's going to listen to this podcast indirectly or directly. In other words, if you're listening to this, there's a non-trivial chance that you already know somebody who's afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.
Starting point is 00:05:25
And tragically, there's an even greater likelihood that at some point you will, whether it be a parent, a loved one, or a friend, or something like that. So I'm relatively unabashed in my praise for Richard's work, and I'm relatively shameless in my plugging for people to fund this type of research. The type of research that Richard does is relatively unsexy. People don't really know what to do with clinical research that is focused
Starting point is 00:05:52
on Alzheimer's prevention. And probably somewhere in the vicinity of like 10 basis points worth of resources, meaning like one tenth of one percent of resources are going into funding this type of work. And after this podcast, Richard and I went out for dinner and we talked about a gift that a patient of mine gave Richard. It was about a $50,000 gift or a $40,000 gift, which is obviously a lot of money. But in the grand scheme of the types of dollars that people are pouring into
Starting point is 00:06:17
this research, it's not that much. And Richard was able to walk me through what came of that gift from that particular patient. And I was so blown away that I came home from dinner and I actually emailed him to tell him the impact of his actual dollars. And I will say this, having spent a lot of my time around biomedical research, it is very rare that a $40,000 gift can move the needle. So if anybody's listening to this and they do feel
Starting point is 00:06:41
touched and compelled to get involved in this space, whether it just be through the standpoint of education and understanding or through funding research, I think Richard's team at Cornell is doing exceptional work. So finally, I'll just close by saying a couple of housekeeping things. One, there's a weekly email that has grown immensely in popularity. So I want to make sure that people who are interested in receiving such an email know about it.
Starting point is 00:07:04
You can sign up for it on the site every Sunday morning. I shoot out an email that kind of highlights things that are interesting to me over the course of the week. I promise to do my best to make it not lame such that it's actually an email worth receiving. Remember on the show notes for this podcast and every podcast are always found on our website. And we put an unbelievable amount of time into that. In fact, more time goes into that, then goes into the podcast. The podcast, you know, two and a half hour discussion, I might spend two hours preparing for it, Bob and Travis, two of our analysts spend double digit hours preparing those show
Starting point is 00:07:35
notes and the feedback has been excellent. So for those of you that maybe aren't utilizing those, it might be something to consider. And of course, if you do find this enjoyable, by all means, please go to Apple, leave a nice review on iTunes, and I guess you can leave a review if you don't like it as well, but I won't push you quite as hard. So without further ado, welcome to my interview with Dr. Richard Isaacson. For Richard, thanks so much for coming over, man. Sure. Thanks for having me. It's not a far walk, is it? Four minutes. Very well.
Starting point is 00:08:05
What do you think of the coaster I gave you? I don't know if that was intentional, but we have someone with dementia, Pugulistica on the coaster, Muhammad Ali. And my brother's a Parkinson's specialist, so he would be the right one to talk to, but yeah, amazing guy. I gave you my Muhammad Ali coaster
Starting point is 00:08:19
without even thinking about the implications of that. Serendipity or synchronicity, which one is that? Not sure. Okay, so before we start this, I just learned something about you today that I have known you for a while. I thought I knew everything, but as we were just getting ready to record,
Starting point is 00:08:34
I was like, oh, by the way, let's just stick our phones on airplane mode and you put about your iPhone and you put on airplane mode and then you whipped out this white and gold diamond-studded thing. Yeah. Can you tell our listeners what that thing was? Well, I'm a very practical guy, so I collect luxury vintage cell phones. It doesn't connect to the internet.
Starting point is 00:08:53
Every 75 text message is the memory gets full, so I have to delete them all. It's very practical. Yeah, I collect vintage luxury cell phones. The word collect implies you have more than just that white thing that's seven, yeah. Describe what it has on it? Well, it's besides the alligator skin on the back. Sure, it's white alligator. It came from Africa, then went to Italy,
Starting point is 00:09:12
and then the skin was then shipped to the UK. I had to get all the passport, all the paperwork, because I got stuck in customs for fish and wildlife, had that phone in customs for like three or four weeks when I ordered it, because they couldn't verify that that wasn't in endangered species. So they found all the paperwork, then it has to get the paper trail of where the fabric came from. It's alligator, white alligator. It was actually assembled, though, the foam was assembled in the UK. And it's got white sapphire keys. It's a
Starting point is 00:09:38
pseudo blackberry. It's actually a Nokia. The Nokia is actually from 2008. The foam was built in 2010. In 2010, this was the fattest phone on the market. And that's pH fat. pH fat. I put the young people. With a pH. Yes, so we have white sapphire keys. We have 18 karat gold trim, white alligator.
Starting point is 00:09:56
Of course, say that a few times. Or are you dating anyone at the time you got this? You're very perceptive, actually. Wait, I didn't talk about the diamonds. It's called a diamond pillow. Am I allowed to include a picture of this thing in the show notes? Absolutely.
Starting point is 00:10:09
I'm looking at it as you're describing it, and I can't freaking believe everything you're saying, except that I'm looking at it. So I know that whoever's listening to this right now is thinking, what are these two clowns talking about? But they need to see this thing. It's called a diamond pillow. That's what they marketed as.
Starting point is 00:10:24
But anyway, it's on airplane mode, so I can keep it on the table. No, please keep it on the table, because that thing is fantastic. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, check this out. The ringer is no joke. I mean, I'm being recorded, so you can like verify this.
Starting point is 00:10:36
But the ringer for these phones was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, specifically for this phone line. I have to ask, how much did that cost in 2010 dollars? In 2010, it was just over 25,000. However, I got it in an auction on eBay. Oh no, you know what? This one I actually got, so the company went out of business last year.
Starting point is 00:10:55
That's right. And they were liquidated. The companies of R2, VER, and the company went out of business last July. They had a blowout auction sale, liquidation sale. So I was the highest bidder. Actually, two people beat me, but then they'd never paid the money. So then at long story short, I was the highest bidder. I won the phone in September. I didn't get it till January because of the customs and all the... Oh, wait, wait. So you didn't actually buy this in 2010?
Starting point is 00:11:17
Oh, I couldn't afford it until 2010. Yeah, okay, okay. I was gonna say, because... But in 2011, I had a girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, who was very... That kind of whatever, and I went to Vegas, and I won $1, because... But in 2011, I had a girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, who was very, that kind of whatever, and I went to Vegas, and I won $1,600 in Vegas. You were a huge slot machine guy, if I recall. Yes, although when I first met you, Jay Walker burst my bubble and said,
Starting point is 00:11:35
it's all luck and random, and I could have sworn it was at my uncle, living in Vegas, my grandfather living in Vegas. So he taught me the way of slot machines, and I thought I'd beat slot machines until Jay Walker that has like 700 slot machine randomization code passwords or patents basically said, no, it's all luck. He burst my bubble. But anyway, I was in Vegas. I go about every year, every other year. And I won $1,600. I was like, oh, yeah. There's this luxury cell phone store.
Starting point is 00:12:00
And I'm going to go buy the phone to impress the girl that I was hanging out with. So we go and I put the phone, we take it out. It was $8,600, not $1,600. So I actually did buy one sticker price for $8,600. That being said, I have- And just to make sure I understand this, you walked in there with 1600 in your pocket, ready to give away your winnings because it's free money. The guy whoips it out, it's $8,600. You can't back away now because the girl you're trying to impress, you have no idea how many questions
Starting point is 00:12:29
I want to ask you, but we will not end up talking about Alzheimer's disease or dementia. So just to summarize, you blew 8,600 dollars in 2011 on a luxury phone. You have since accumulated six more of them, including a retail $25,000 pimp phone that we're going to include a picture of that you got for hopefully a lot less than that. You know it was a problem. It was the shipping and the customs fees and like the all the that.
Starting point is 00:12:52
This is a humanitarian crisis. I mean, seriously. Like I collected old blackberries. You. Yeah, going back to like, remember the very first one which was like a wedge that was a pager. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So I just wanted one of every generation of Blackberry.
Starting point is 00:13:06
Weird. But I didn't get blinged out ones. Like I just wanted like the regular one. And I also collected Hewitt Packard calculators, all of the HPs. Now I never got some of the originals because those were just too out of my price range. But and I thought that was weird. But I got to tell you this might be a bit weird.
Starting point is 00:13:23
Well, here's the thing wrong with that. Here's the deal though. I've spent less than $12,000, $13,000 total because of the auctions and the deals and whatever, and I've traded in some and then they once sent me a loaner and kept it because they forgot they sent it to me, the company didn't have to business now, so they won't come after me. But actually, so you think. True. Good point. So I actually have $80 thousand dollars of cell phones that have actually only paid 13,000 for so no I'm gonna use it on like me rationalizing the dumb shit I buy like I have X thousands of dollars worth of Why that I only paid Z for but like Z is still probably anyway?
Starting point is 00:14:01
I'm not gonna judge because I am the last guy that should be judging But I cannot wait to include a picture of that phone. It's just hard to believe it exists. It's like it was handmade and the signature was behind the battery, the guy signed it in the middle. I can't believe we have been talking for six minutes and 55 seconds, and we could talk for another hour just about this.
Starting point is 00:14:23
That's how many more questions I have to probe your psyche the Ferrari one that I have This is a good one too the Ferrari one actually they stuck a recorder underneath the Ferrari in 2010 to record the sound Ferrari Accelerating and that Ferrari is the ringer the acceleration sound. See that's one I could get into yeah That's an I might have to borrow that one. That's beautiful That's like bling. It's like got a red back cue. Like you can see the red lights and the... Anyway, I didn't know such a market existed.
Starting point is 00:14:51
Well, the company went, this is, Needless to say, it doesn't really exist. Oh, and then there was the one, last, sorry, I'm sorry. Then there was the one where I bought it. This is your show. You can literally talk about whatever you want. This is a great one because I bought,
Starting point is 00:15:03
I got such a great deal online. I couldn't figure it out and I get this phone. I was so excited and it's all in Chinese. So I would text my friends, family, just in Chinese. Just then they wouldn't know what I was saying. I didn't know what I was saying. That was a problem. So when you say text, just randomly type characters.
Starting point is 00:15:19
Yes. And I was hysterical. People were like, what are you talking about? I'm getting Chinese characters, and I would reply in Chinese, and that's a great phone. It's on the shelf still, but that was a nice phone, very inexpensive.
Starting point is 00:15:31
Oh, God, this is fantastic. We might have to do a dedicated episode just on this stuff. I'll bring them on, I'll turn them on. Okay, well, onto the Monday. I was reading through something, because we've known each other for several years now, but there are a bunch of things you just don't know about a person until you realize,
Starting point is 00:15:48
oh, you know, I'm gonna sit down and bridge it and talk to them, I wanna learn at least like five things about him that like tell me a little bit about how he got to where he got. So I'm reading through this and the two things that I learned, well now three, given this, this bling phone thing, but the two things that I learned about you
Starting point is 00:16:02
were you had finished medical school before I had started medical school. You finished med school at 23. The other thing I learned about you is you were a rip-roaring DJ. DJ and recording producer, my name was DJ Rush. I had a recording studio in my basement growing up with my bar mitzvah money. Actually, I took all the money and bought out this other guy, this older guy's old recording studio. So I got like, again, it's all about value. So I spent like three grand, which is a lot back then, huge amount of money, but it was all of my bar mitzvah money, all the presents. And I got like 12,
Starting point is 00:16:34
$15,000 a recording equipment. And magically I set up a recording studio and I actually put an ad in the penny saver. I'm dating myself now. I grew up in Suffolk County in Long Island in Komeh, and I put an ad in the Penny Savor, and people in Queens were my best customers, because people in Queens would usually go to the city and pay all this money for recording, but then they would come out east to Suffolk County, and that's how I made money in high school. Did that help you fund college or anything like that?
Starting point is 00:16:59
No, I was a computer tutor. I had like 400 bucks in cash from computer tutoring for college that I got to use No, I didn't you ended up spending that money you reinvested it you reinvested the recording in music equipment random weird guitar Is shaped the NJ warlock like this weird looking guitar thing. Yes. I like weird. It's not weird man It's beautiful. Appreciate it embrace it When you went to med school, did you know that you wanted to be a neurologist? You sort of.
Starting point is 00:17:26
Yeah, if you don't think I'm a dork for collecting luxury vintage cell phones, this is even more ridiculous. But I was in summer camp in sixth, seventh grade, and it was teen travel, and we would go to, like, I think we're on a trip to Tennessee, actually, and we're heading on down to Nashville, and on the bus, I brought, I shouldn't giggle, but neuroanademy made easy and understandable. It's like neuroanademy for dummies. Exactly.
Starting point is 00:17:52
It's probably the same series. Yep, that's exactly what it was. And this is, I was in sixth, seventh grade. My brother was a neurologist. Your brother's older? He's older, he's 13 years older than me. So he was finishing med school also at 23. He did a six year program also.
Starting point is 00:18:04
I was 10 So I got his hand me down books he would leave them in the room and I would I guess read them So I think I was interested in the brain, but I could never even though I had this book I would read this book a hundred times. I have no conception of neuroanatomy I just like it's just like way over my head even though I started studying it when I was 11 So you guys are from an underachieving family You also had an uncle I believe that was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease when you were quite young started studying it when I was 11. So you guys are from an underachieving family. You also had an uncle, I believe, that was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease
Starting point is 00:18:28
when you were quite young. Yeah, so my uncle was diagnosed when I was in high school. And I always knew I was gonna be neurologist. I didn't know exactly which area or which field. I think the brain was interesting. I also kind of chose neurology because it was the most challenging. I wanted to be challenged for my career.
Starting point is 00:18:42
But honestly, when I was in residency, I guess I just felt a connection to older people I didn't exactly have grandparents. I only had a grandfather who passed away when I was eight and I didn't meet any of my other grandparents They passed away before I was born and I don't know. I just felt a connection to older people So that was part of it. I guess I could have seen myself doing Parkinson's disease I actually in some ways the plan was to go to like a as best of a residency as I could So I could then one day join my brother in practice live in Florida. But I wasn't sure about Parkinson's. I liked it. I liked Alzheimer's
Starting point is 00:19:10
also. I like cognitive neurology. I actually trained in Betheschaul Deaconess Medical Center in Boston where cognitive neurology really was born in the first place in the United States. A picture of Norman Gesh was in the conference room. So a long story short, I think cognitive neurology was always challenging and interesting, but I didn't just want to do phenomenology like, oh, look at this aphasia or look at this whatever. I wanted to treat patients and I think because I understood what it was like, you know, Alzheimer's terrible.
Starting point is 00:19:39
Just like a terrible, terrible, horrible disease. I don't want to get like, you know, emotional and upset, but it's just terrible. And just like my uncle Bob introduced my parents, so that's number one. So that's why I'm here today. And this is a complete true story. I was three.
Starting point is 00:19:52
My uncle Bob was in the Navy, and I was at my aunt Carol's house also in Long Island, and I jumped into the pool. I sank to the bottom, and everyone was inside. And my uncle Bob ran out, jumped in and saved me. To this day, I actually avoid water. I hate swimming.
Starting point is 00:20:07
I hate, I don't go in the ocean. I don't go in baths. I mean, I stay away from water. You were traumatized by that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I can't even, I don't want to go near pool. I don't go in pools.
Starting point is 00:20:16
I don't like the feeling of water. My Uncle Bob, obviously, was a special guy. But just to see, like, he was the life of the party. That was like that relative where he had a saying, what a party, like at all the weddings and whatever. So it just to see someone like that become what he became and then just to see what the toll took on his daughter and son's just it was just a terrible horrible disease.
Starting point is 00:20:39
So I think I empathized with it, I understood it and that's really where I chose to forge the career path. I think it's so interesting how many people in medicine have a story about a moment that either a moment or an interaction or relationship that became so pointed in their decision to enter medicine. I don't think that's absolutely necessary. I mean, I think many people enter medicine for sort of less specific or less tangible reasons, but I'm always amazed by these stories.
Starting point is 00:21:08
So I appreciate you sharing that. Let's fast forward a little bit and talk about you finish residency in Boston. And then did you come back to New York? No, so I actually left New York for longer than I was in New York. I graduated at 17. I spent six years in Kansas City. This is a six year medical program. And so I finished early.
Starting point is 00:21:24
This is how the way most other countries do in Europe and in Asia. But actually the unique part about our program was medical school from day one. So I'm 17 years old, University of Missouri in Kansas City. I have my lab coat and literally Tuesday and Thursday. I was in the hospital. And Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I was in college. And it was a very unique blended program. And I couldn't ask for anything more.
Starting point is 00:21:45
I had literally six years of medical experience. I was doing tons of medicine. I was doing electives throughout the country, throughout the world. I did a history of neurology, tore throughout Europe for one of the elective months. So I just got so much medicine exposure. Usually medical students get two years of clinical medicine.
Starting point is 00:22:01
I had like six years intermittently of clinical medicine. So I did that, then I popped over to Miami for a year to do medicine training and then to Boston for three years. And then I headed back to Miami. My mom was down there, my family's down there. So I headed back down there. And I was in Miami for eight and a half years.
Starting point is 00:22:16
Oh, is that how you met your fiance? Yep, you got it in Miami. And my band was playing. She was in the front row. Wait, what do you play? I play bass. Okay, cause you grew up playing the cello that I base. Okay, because you grew up playing the cello, that I knew. I did, I grew up playing the cello until I got a fight
Starting point is 00:22:28
with my orchestra teacher. I told him to go F himself and that was the end of that. He had this like complex, you know, it was like I'm better than you because he was in a Maxwell House commercial. He was the conductor in the Maxwell House commercial. And like, I don't know. Exactly.
Starting point is 00:22:43
He was the conductor in the Maxwell House commercial. So like, you know, he was his crap didn't stink. So I just couldn't take it and I told him to FU and I walked out and. What, how old were you? I was probably in 10th grade. 10th grade. So then I joined a band actually. Is it easy to transition from cello to bass?
Starting point is 00:22:58
I didn't practice, didn't take a lot. I took two lessons. That's right. I took two lessons and I just kind of, but the fingering is similar. Yeah, the frets through me actually. The frets were hard, so I actually got a fretless bass. I joined a band with some of my friends and then actually the guitarist and one of the bands I joined has been living on my couch for a year and a half. That's a whole another story. But a lot of stories in your life. Yeah, like keeping it simple, you know. Exactly.
Starting point is 00:23:21
So played bass, always been into music. So you you're the bass playing neurologist, hipster in Miami. Yep, meet the blonde girl sitting in the club. So, yeah, I was wearing my Mexican wrestling mask and shirtless, yeah, my band had this stick. We were called the Regenerates music for the right brain. And our logo was this brain, but we had like the stick where we played like, anyway, long story short.
Starting point is 00:23:46
But yes, it's not video evidence of this. Oh, we can link it all over Facebook. Okay, very well. The regenerates. We have 99 likes on Facebook. So Travis and Bob in preparing the follow-up show notes for this will have a challenge trying to just focus on some of the Alzheimer's stuff we talk about and limiting the bling phones and band photos and videos to 10% of the total volume of show notes. The phone is called the Virtue Constellation.
Starting point is 00:24:14
Oh, we're going to be taking a picture of it after we talk, don't you? I actually... Nothing will be left to the imagination. I had professional pictures taken of the phone. Because I dropped it. It took like a few. Because I dropped it. It took like a few years. I dropped it. I'm sitting here laughing at you and look on my wall there's professional photos of watches. I feel much better in the Blackberry collection.
Starting point is 00:24:35
I'm redeemed. I don't even know who I am the judge. So then what got you to New York? I guess in life one needs to make a decision kind of where one goes and what priorities one has. Miami was amazing. I had amazing opportunities. I wrote a book back in 2010 and then it came out like first week in 2011 called All-Termist Treatment, All-Termist Prevention, a Patient and Family Guide. And I put together in this book, this plan about what I do for my patients.
Starting point is 00:24:58
I used to, I was known in Miami for spending a lot of time with patients and when patients would leave, they would always have like ten things to do or 15 things to do. And that was very unique because most people, neurologists, there's a saying it's called diagnosed and adios, and neurologists don't treat disease, we admire it. Well, not me, I'm going to because of my family history, because of whatever one thing leads to another and I want to do anything and everything as long as it's evidence-based and safe. So I was known for jamming the printer in the neurology department because my recommendations
Starting point is 00:25:29
was like sometimes 10 pages, 15 pages and I put together nutrition, little pamphlet and this. And you know, I got to the point where I was jamming the printer so much that I went to kinkos, I had a bound, it was more expensive to bind it. So I wrote this book and I would give the book to the patient, it was like printed out like two dollars to print out the book. So I would give the book to the patient. It was like printed out like two dollars to print out the book. So I would give the book to the patients and then magically that today's show called One Day Meeting an Expert
Starting point is 00:25:49
about like music and Alzheimer's disease, which I talked about publicly. Next thing I know I'm selling hundreds of books online and put up a website and all that kind of thing. So why do I tell the story? I tell the story and not just sell books. I don't care about selling books, but when I wrote the book, I got a lot of flack because in the title, I wrote Alzheimer's treatment, Alzheimer's prevention.
Starting point is 00:26:07
This plan, what is this plan that you're telling people to do, show them the evidence? You know, there's FDA-proved drugs that may work marginally, but what is all this other stuff you're doing? It's crap. So, you know, I talked to the Alzheimer's Association on the phone and they said, no, you can't say this. And I talked to the, actually, a colleague, I shouldn't really say this, but there's a colleague down the hall for me in my academic appointment. I knew his wife did this. I shouldn't be saying this
Starting point is 00:26:29
again. It's being recorded, but whatever. His wife wrote a really negative scathing review about my book. It was actually probably him writing the review. And I said to myself, but I really believe in this, I'm not trying to sell books. I don't give a crap about books. I made the book large print, and it's cost more money to print, and I make less money per book, and I don't give a crap about books. I made the book large print and it's cost more money to print and I make less money per book and I don't care. I want better quality pages. And I just, I don't want to say that someone questioned my integrity or whatever, but I guess someone questioned my integrity and I, I'm not trying to sell something. I believe than it. And the only way to prove in a rigorous way that multimodal interventions work, whether it's patient education, lifestyle interventions,
Starting point is 00:27:05
pharmacologic management, everything. The only way to prove that that works, the only way to do that is in the large academic medical center. I basically interviewed in New York and Boston. I was about this close to go back to Boston. I had a great offer at Harvard. It would have been a major stepping stone in my career to be that age and that level to be an associate professor and director of an Alzheimer's clinic but they wouldn't
Starting point is 00:27:27
let me use the term prevention. So when I came to interview a Cornell and my chair said oh yeah Alzheimer's prevention that's probably going to be something new sure and the dean as she was signing my letter back in 2012 said no I got to meet this guy. So July 4th, 2012 I'm all like oh oh it's about to move to New York what's happening and I go meet her and I got a 15 this guy. So July 4th, we're in 2012. I'm all like, uh-oh, it's about to move to New York. What's happening? And I go meet her. And I got a 15-minute meeting. I had a seller on, because it's literally the only place in the country that I was allowed, because I called around and whatever. I wanted to start this all-time-ers prevention thing. And she interviewed me and she,
Starting point is 00:27:58
you know, I had written about my CV. It was like, I think- This was the Dean of Cornell Medical School. Dean of the Medical School. This is like the CEO of the Medical School. Exactly. The Dean of the Medical School says, no, I'm not signing this guy's letter. We're not starting an all-time-age prevention clinic. That's crazy. I have to meet him. I was given 15 minutes on our calendar, or plead my case.
Starting point is 00:28:13
And the first question she had for me. Did you bring in a bling phone? No, but I was so prepared. I had like a collated folder, and I had a USB with all the evidence, and I was ready to go. And I walk in, and she looks at me. She looks down and I walk in and she looks at me, she looks down at my CV and she looks at me and she says, how old are you? She doesn't know your doogie house, her man.
Starting point is 00:28:33
She was expecting the traditional bearded bow tie, older 50s, whatever 60s, neurologist type and I'm going to look like that. So we talked about my age and my training and the 23 things. Which by the way, today is probably not even legal. Probably. Exactly. And then in the last two minutes of after talking about the age and how the CV got so long, I basically said, listen, I'm serious. This is my plan. I'm not over promising. Alzheimer's starts in the brain decades before the first symptom. People don't know that. I don't even think she realized that.
Starting point is 00:29:07
When someone's diagnosed with dementia, didn't start that day, it started decades before. I explained this to her. The new criteria had just came out, the new diagnostic criteria come out like that summer. And she said, okay, I'll let you do this prevention thing. And that's it. The only place that I could have gone
Starting point is 00:29:22
in the country, possibly the world, who knows, to do what I have tried to do and what I've actually been able to accomplish in the last five and a half years is New York City, just a, and while Cornell and New York Presbyterian has been the saying for New York Presbyterian is amazing things are happening here and I'm not trying to give a commercial, but just know where their place that I would have been able to do this. So you mentioned diagnostic criteria.
Starting point is 00:29:44
So let's start from the beginning, because at least once a week I got a call from a friend or a patient saying, I think my mom or my dad is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and I say, well, tell me why, tell me a bit more. And they're like, well, you know, my mom's just having a harder time remembering things. She's repeating herself or my dad is, you know, having a hard time filling the blank, right? So how is the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease made and how does it differ from other types of dementia? Alzheimer's disease has traditionally been a clinical diagnosis, meaning you talk to a
Starting point is 00:30:15
patient like you were doing. You get a history of progressive short-term memory loss and when that memory loss and other cognitive changes and sometimes sleep trouble and behavior changes, depression, agitation, whatever. So cognition, sleep, psychiatric, comorbidities, when all of these cognitive brain symptoms cause activities of daily living to be no longer able to be done by that person, then that person has something called probable Alzheimer's disease dementia. So in the past, the clinical way was to talk to the patient, progressive short-term memory loss, common things happen commonly. It's probably going to be Alzheimer's disease.
Starting point is 00:30:55
Now, it's about 60, 70% of the time. When people get older, sometimes they forget things. They lose their keys. You have a word on the tip of your tongue, but you remember that later, you find your keys later, that can be non-pathological changes associated with age. So there's something called age-related cognitive change or cognitive aging is even the more appropriate term. Cognitive aging is separate from Alzheimer's disease, but it doesn't lead to a pathological diagnosis in the brain, and it doesn't lead to alterations and activities of daily living.
Starting point is 00:31:25
People can still take care of themselves, they can still pay bills and it function independently. So Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, but there's different forms of dementia also. There's frontotemporal dementia, which is more of a behavioral problem. There's dementia with Lewy bodies, and that's similar to Parkinson's disease symptoms along with dementia. It was reported that after Robin Williams' death that he had Lewy body dementia superimposed on whatever else people had speculated was going on. Is that true? Or is that just a rumor? No, that's true. I've heard his wife at a, she was honored at the American Academy of Erology last year, and she talked about this, and he, I didn't treat him, I don't diagnose, can say only from a periphery, but it seems from what I've heard, some of the paranoia, the hallucinations, the slowed movements,
Starting point is 00:32:10
the vivid dreams, acting out dreams, it seemed pretty consistent. And would those be different from a patient presenting with the more typical Alzheimer's disease? In other words, are those slightly more unique to Louis-Body dementia? Yeah, so, you know, by far Alzheimer's disease. Which I've been told by the way can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. Yeah, I mean, I'm a clinical diagnostician. So it's a new era, it's a new world. So when your friends or your patients call you and say,
Starting point is 00:32:35
does my mom have Alzheimer's disease, you listen to the story. Neurologic diagnosis should be made based on the history, 80 to 90 percent of the time. So I still always defer to the clinical impression, but in 2018, 1920, etc. it's just a different world. We can do biomarkers, so we can do scans and does the person have amyloid in the brain while that's Alzheimer's. But then again, people with Lewy body dementia also have amyloid. So it's confusing, but long story short, when people have progressive short-term memory loss and other cognitive changes, it's confusing, but long story short, when people have progressive short-term memory loss and other cognitive changes, it's probably Alzheimer's will prove and otherwise the key
Starting point is 00:33:10
thing is that we have to rule out reversible causes, so make sure they don't have thyroid trouble or B12 deficiency, things like that. Pretty uncommon, 5% of the time, 8% of the time, whatever it is. And a lot of times people have a thyroid problem or a B12 deficiency, you'll fix it, and maybe the symptoms will get a little better, but they may have Alzheimer's anyway. So we want to rule out reversible causes. We always have to do some brain imaging, either a CAT scan, got a rule out of tumor, or a MRI. Now the American Academy Neurology states you can do any brain imaging. In my clinical practice, we always recommend an MRI.
Starting point is 00:33:42
What phase of MRI? Just a regular MRI, no contrast. And you just want to make it. Which image are you looking at? The T1 or the T2? Well, I want to look at everything. You know, is there a vascular burden? Could this be vascular cognitive impairment? By itself, could this be vascular?
Starting point is 00:33:55
End Alzheimer's, because about 35% of the time, you have Alzheimer's end vascular cognitive impairment. So you just want to get a sense of what it looks like. But to me, when I look at an MRI, I look for atrophy, shrinkage of the brain. And if the frontal lobes, which is the planning, processing, higher order thinking part of the brain, and the temporal lobes, which is the memory center of the brain, especially the part of the brain called the hippocampus.
Starting point is 00:34:16
Hippocampus, I think in Latin, means seahorse. Basically, looks like a little seahorse thing when it's cut. And if there's a hole in the hippocampus, where the big space of shrinkage, even without a fancy biomarkers, which we'll talk about, progressive short-term memory loss and atrophy in the brain in certain Alzheimer's specific areas, especially the hippocampus is Alzheimer's still proven otherwise. Now, again, it's a new era. We can check for amyloid in the brain. We can look for amyloid and tau in the spinal fluid. You know, even soon we'll be able to do tau scans. Tau protein is another, like amyloid pathologic protein that gets built up in the brain of a person with Alzheimer's. And you can look at these
Starting point is 00:34:54
biomarkers to make a definitive diagnosis to this person of Alzheimer's. The only main reason to do that is if we're going to think about a clinical trial because if you get into a clinical trial, the only way to do that is to have Alzheimer's in the brain. And in the past, and we'll talk about why have so many Alzheimer's drugs failed, why have studies left and right failure, failure, failure. There was one study that, you know, this was only like five or six years ago before the era of biomarkers. There was one study where 40% of the people with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in the study did not have amyloid in the brain
Starting point is 00:35:29
But they were getting anti-amyloid treatments. This was later found with a scan or on autopsy Some different studies have done in different ways. So the take home point here is that Alzheimer's is a little confusing You can make a clinical diagnosis, but the clinical diagnosis isn't always correct So that's why we need to think about biomarkers in certain situations. You talked a lot about short-term memory. Where do you see changes? When do you see changes in other parameters of cognition, such as executive function or processing speed?
Starting point is 00:35:57
So, when I think about the brain, I think about different areas, and I don't want to say, like, pin the tail on donkey, but it's like, you know, pin the tail on the part of the brain that's manifesting a change in cognition So you know memory there's short-term memory. There's long-term memory Enable to have a memory someone needs to be able to pay attention to something So another area of the brain in terms of cognitive function is processing speed or attention and they're pretty similar Then there's executive function which which is higher order processing, judgment planning, things like that.
Starting point is 00:36:27
There's other things, language is important, learning is important. If you can't learn something, how can you remember it? So what we do is we try to really hone in on exactly what the cognitive domain or cognitive area is deficient. So for example, when you have someone call you and say, oh, my memory is terrible. Well, is it really memory? That's what cognitive assessments do. When my nephew was texting, I can't say when I'm texting because my phone's from 2010, but when my nephew is texting it, they could check in Chinese, though. Do you have the other one? Oh, that's a great phone. Next podcast. I'll bring that. Someone's texting and not paying attention. And then I asked my nephew a question 20 minutes later, it's not like they forgot.
Starting point is 00:37:08
They never, they've never assimilated. Exactly, they've never encoded it, and never got into the memory. So we always want to make sure it's an attentional thing, because for example, common things happen commonly. Dementia, common, but depression is also very common and a pseudo-dimension of depression is very common, so if someone says I can't remember it, but if they're depressed,
Starting point is 00:37:29
whether it's a serotonin issue, whether it's whatever, and you do the testing, they're not able to be attentive during the exams, so they're not remembering. If you treat the depression, for example, serotonin drugs or whatever else, well, then the attention gets boosted and then the memory comes back. So it's not a dementia due to a neurodegenerative condition. It's a pseudo-dimension due to depression. So there's a lot of things out there and that's why getting to the root of the which area of the brain is truly not working is key. Short-term memory, long-term memory, processing speed, attention, that kind of thing. It was about three or four years ago when I realized I wanted to start including cognitive
Starting point is 00:38:08
testing in our assessments in our practice. And so Dan Pallichar, who is one of our analysts at the time, I said, I tasked Dan with this problem. I said, Dan, I want you to go out there and I want you to learn everything about cognitive testing so that we can get the best in class. You know, we're going to do the best blood testing in Madagena. We're going to do the best this, the best this, the best this, the best cognitive testing so that we can get the best in class. We're going to do the best blood testing imagine, and we're going to do the best this, the best this, the best this, the best cognitive testing. Well, that turned out to be a fool's errand because he came back with, I don't know, 27 different tests that one could do.
Starting point is 00:38:38
Some of these were clinical tests, like the NIH had a toolkit with all of its tests within it, but then there were a bunch of commercial tests you could do online. And, you know, look at this stuff. And, I mean, my take on this sort of commercially available ones, because there was one problem that immediately became obvious to me, which is it took a great deal of skill to administer a subset of these tests. So immediately said, we're not going to do those tests, because like, we don't have the skill to do it, and we're not going to invest the time to do that, because we don't have the patient to do it and we're not gonna invest the time to do that because we don't have the patient volume like we're not an Alzheimer's
Starting point is 00:39:08
clinic right. So we figured we have to use an off the shelf thing. And I was like these all strike me as like kind of bullshit. But I was like look here's the definitive assessment we're gonna do. And I had Dan maybe I shouldn't be saying this story online but it's probably legal. If not let's bleep this part out, please. Bob, I basically had Dan at a bunch of his buddies like get together one night at their place. They're all over 21, by the way. And take the test.
Starting point is 00:39:33
Each of them took the test. Like there was like six guys that each took the test and then do a shot. I provided the alcohol and then redo the test and then do a shot and then redo the test and then do a shot. And I think they did this for six rounds. And my question was, if the test is truly a measure of cognitive capacity that cannot be learned, their performance should deteriorate. If you can learn the test, then their performance should
Starting point is 00:39:59
stay flat or even get a little bit better as they become inebriated. Of course, their performance was flat. Six hours later, whatever, their eight drinks into this thing, they're hammered. They're doing just as well in the cognitive test. At that point, I was like, okay, we are not going to solve this problem using over-the-counter commercial tests. That's when you and I already knew each other, but that's when I was like, all right, Richard, what is going on with this cognitive testing thing? Then, I came into the clinic, I met you, I met Holly, I met the that's when I was like, all right Richard, what is going on with this cognitive testing thing? And then I came into the clinic, I met you,
Starting point is 00:40:26
I met Holly, I met the team, and I was like, oh yeah, we're never doing this. Like we're gonna send our high risk patients to you guys because this is way too much work. It's really complicated. Oh, this has been complicated for decades and you know just to tell a quick story. I mean, first of all, our battery,
Starting point is 00:40:41
the cognitive test we do is we do about little more than half on computer because you you know, we use the NIH toolbox. We also use odor identification, which is important. And that's hard to have a practice effect on some tests or less practice-effectable, other tests are common to expect that. We use pen and paper tests. So what we've done is we've put together an hour and 20, 30 minute battery that kind of is the greatest hits that tries to look at people that are, you know, in the normal slash very early phases of Alzheimer's
Starting point is 00:41:08
The problem is that most of the cognitive tests out there have really been scaled or used and validated and meant for people with dementia. So they're not sensitive to pick up people with early cognitive decline who do not have dementia. Exactly. And the newer tests just don't have the robust validation in people who are normal versus normal, no amelude in the brain versus normal with amelude in the brain. And until we have thousands of people that do that, any off the shelf or in some other than others for sure, we just don't have the perfect solution. This actually is a great time to talk about this, but this past weekend we had the first ever Alzheimer's prevention clinic and brain health clinic symposium, where all of us, there's six centers like this, like ours now, we were the first ever Alzheimer's prevention clinic and brain health clinic symposium where all of us are there's six centers like this like ours now
Starting point is 00:41:47
We were the first in 2000. Where are the other five in 2014 the Alzheimer's risk assessment early intervention program in University of Alabama Birmingham open 2014 very different model than us. It's a two visit model sort of thing they get in the Mariah And it's just a different way to do it great person down there David Galbacher Then actually we open to satellite clinic in Puerto Rico and the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic and Research Center of Puerto Rico, doing amazing, everything was great. And then, oh boy, she didn't have power for six months.
Starting point is 00:42:16
She's picking up the pieces, patients coming for prevention, patients need to come to get electricity and get psychological counseling for the PTSD after the storm. She's calling it PTSD and pobolo. I think that's what she calls it. So that was a tough time, but we're still running. We have the Brain Health Center at North Shore Hospital in Chicago in Evanston, Illinois.
Starting point is 00:42:36
I'll be there next week. Oh, cool. Yeah, good people over there. They have a very heavily focused on electronic medical record to try to track these things. newest center is actually two ones in Boko Ratan, Florida, at a flared Atlantic University in Boko Ratan, the dementia prevention initiative, Jim Galvan is like, if you think we do a deep dive, Jim Galvan does the deepest dive. I mean, we're talking to like the magma of the earth. He does from bone density to metabolomics and proteomics to EEG. I mean, if there's an outcome measure, he does it, but that's a zectopartis and he's super
Starting point is 00:43:10
great at that. And then the newest center is opening at the Pacific John Wayne Cancer Institute, but it's Providence St. John's and it's called the Pacific Brain Health Center in Santa Monica, California. A really great people that recruited from UCLA, David Marles, one of them. And we're all, for the first time, trying to collaborate and trying to harmonize these measures, because honestly, I don't know what the right measures are. We're trying to create an additional free cognitive assessment that can be done online, but the toolbox can only be done on computer and iPad. The versions that we built were actually on the phone. So we built six versions of something
Starting point is 00:43:45
called the Face Name Associative Memory Test. We worked with Dorine Rents to help us with this. She's amazing. She validated this where if you do poorly on a Face Name Associative Memory, that predicts amyloid in the brain. So what we've done is then we then created all these. Do you remember how predictive it was? Don't quote me on that kind of stuff, but it's pretty predictive. It worked pretty well. I don't remember from the paper, but we created these tests and it was not the NIH per se. It was a different reputable organization because the words Alzheimer's and prevention was in our name, they didn't want to use our tools or really be associated with our programs. So we've been getting tomatoes thrown at us for quite some time. And for example,
Starting point is 00:44:22
this symposium we had this weekend, we had all these brain health centers, we all get criticism. And we all get criticism because, for example, we don't even know what are the right tools to use, which are the best cognitive tests, which is this, which is that. So we've been getting criticism for a long time. However, thankfully, the tide is turning.
Starting point is 00:44:40
And it's kind of a new day and a new era. For example, even the last year, the Alzheimer's Association put out 10 tips for brain health to preserve cognitive health. That's amazing. This year, at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago, the amount of the word prevention that we're used
Starting point is 00:44:57
was, I couldn't believe it, prevention this, prevention that. Now, there's a big, big, big debate on Alzheimer's prevention or Alzheimer's risk reduction, which is the most accurate term. We just got our foundational methods paper accepted. And the paper, as we titled it, was the clinical practice of Alzheimer's prevention, a precision medicine approach, went through the review process. Now this is the journal Alzheimer's and dementia, the journal of the Alzheimer's Association.
Starting point is 00:45:21
It's the number one journal of Alzheimer's journals. It's the number four ranked clinical journal in neurology. Great. It's Impact Factor 12.75, whatever it is. This is the first time they've ever published anything from us. So that's good news, but one of the six reviewers said, no, you can't use prevention. The title, you have to change it to risk reduction.
Starting point is 00:45:42
That then led us to write another paper, which I hopefully will be submitting soon, called Alzheimer's Prevention versus Alzheimer's Risk Reduction, Transcending Semantics for Clinical Practice. Because there's a big difference in my mind about prevention versus risk reduction. There's also implications, because when you say prevention, the patient sitting in front of you gets that. When you say risk reduction, what kind of message is that to the public? It's confusing. So, there's this whole semantic argument we went through this with our paper. I had a different experience several years ago that has given me a window into understanding
Starting point is 00:46:12
where this resistance comes from. So it was probably four years ago and I was asked to give a grand rounds and discuss breast cancer. But specifically to discuss the use of metformin in the risk reduction of breast cancer. And so I gave this long talk about all of these topics. And one of the implications of my talk was that if metformin could be effective in reducing the risk of breast cancer, the question then became, could dietary choices also impact breast cancer? So one of the questions was posed. If a woman has breast cancer, is she better off eating ice cream or not eating ice cream? And I said, look, all things equal.
Starting point is 00:46:53
My intuition is she's better off not eating ice cream given that most breast cancers are quite insulin sensitive, they're very sensitive to IGF and other growth factors. This one person in the room who is very senior, quite an opinionated individual who I'm not overly fond of, basically leapt up and down and said, you know, this is complete bullshit. The moment you start suggesting, and I had to ask like 12 questions to get at the layer of the hostility, but it became very clear to me what the hostility stem from, which was an understandable opposition.
Starting point is 00:47:22
It was, if you start talking about breast cancer prevention, if you start suggesting that a person with breast cancer can change the way they eat to reduce their risk of death from this disease, you are implying that the patient brought this disease on themselves. Now, again, I think that's an error. I think there's a logical fallacy there,
Starting point is 00:47:40
but I believe that that logic exists in Alzheimer's disease as well. I think that when we talk about Alzheimer's prevention, somehow it is being turned into, well, then you're saying patients are bringing this on themselves. It's their fault. There could be something done to prevent this, therefore, you know, and we don't like that message. So that's what my intuition tells me is this opposition.
Starting point is 00:48:00
And unfortunately, I think that type of third grade JV poor understanding of logic and risk is basically slowing down progress in this space immensely. As evidenced by the fact that you can't get a grant. I mean, this was true a year ago. You can tell me this is true today. Things are much better now. Things are totally different. Things are totally different.
Starting point is 00:48:19
You could not get a grant to study Alzheimer's prevention if you had the word prevention in the grant title. Zero. We have three NIH grants now. Actually, I just got a like a fourth little part. So, we have like 3.1 NIH grants. I mean, that's not... Any of these RO1s? Yeah, one, we have one part of a program project. One RO1, we're looking at... The program project looks at women between the ages of 40 to 65, looking at the... Well, apparently, menopause. Well, perimenopause. Yeah, well, it's funny. You say 40s early.
Starting point is 00:48:47
I say we need to start at 30, but no 40 to 65, I think is a good sweet spot. And we're looking at women between the ages of 40 to 65. That's the program project. Then we just got Lisa Moscone's, the PI on the men's brain imaging. So we're looking at menopause transition as the window of opportunity, like when do we need to intervene and how?
Starting point is 00:49:06
And then the RO1 we got was the men's brain imaging study, which is basically the male menopause transition, which is Andrew Paws. So we're looking at, it's a small number, only 15 men a year for four years, but it's better than nothing, between 40 and 65. We then just got an administrative supplement to now image women, not just at baseline, but also at 18 months
Starting point is 00:49:26
So we just got that today actually and then I mean that's pretty pretty good Yeah, no, that's a huge improvement and so much of what you just said now makes me want to take a step forward So let's start with the following How do you define in your clinic? What a high-risk patient means? What is the definition of a high-risk patient? Anyone with a brain is at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Well, let's take a step further back from that. What is the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States today? No one knows. You'll see 5.1 million Americans, 5.3 million Americans, 5.7 million Americans. This is all estimations based on one county in Illinois from years ago,
Starting point is 00:50:04
and then it's been extrapolated and then posted all over again. So why don't we have those data the way we do for cancer, for example? All timers is confusing. I mean, there's Alzheimer's dementia and probably around four or five million people have it, but the best numbers were recently published. The most updated was that 47 million Americans have preclinical Alzheimer's disease, meaning Alzheimer's in the brain, but no symptoms. Sorry. Meaning based on something you would see on an imaging study or a lumbar puncture or because those would be basically the only two ways you could see something in the brain
Starting point is 00:50:36
today, 47 million people would have that finding. That also must be an estimate, but do not yet have cognitive impairment. Yep. So five-ish million people have dementia due to Alzheimer's. 47 million Americans have Alzheimer's in their brain, but no symptoms yet. There's people before that with no Alzheimer's in their brain and no symptoms, and we don't know if they're gonna get it yet. And then there's a kind of gray area in between
Starting point is 00:51:02
called mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. And we don't exactly have the best numbers on that, but it's somewhere between the transition phase between preclinical, pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's and dementia due to Alzheimer's. It's stage one, stage two, and stage three. When I talk to my patients about death, which if you're trying to practice longevity, you have to be able to talk about death. I share with them the obvious, which is once you reach about the age of 40, assuming you're not a smoker, your probability of dying from cerebral vascular disease, cardiovascular
Starting point is 00:51:33
disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease is north of 75%. And almost without exception, within that constellation of disease is the one that people fear most as Alzheimer's disease. But a very few patients actually understand what it means to die from Alzheimer's disease. And this becomes a bit challenging when one starts to look at death certificates. And maybe this is part of the problem in coming up with an accurate estimate of that.
Starting point is 00:51:59
How do people actually die when they have Alzheimer's dementia? Yes, so Alzheimer's disease is a indirect cause of death. You know, for example, when someone gets a urinary tract infection, that urinary tract infection may be treated by antibiotics because the patient will say, oh, it hurts. I'm going more frequently. Test my urine and give me an antibiotic. But when someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they're not able to convey this and that
Starting point is 00:52:26
UTI becomes pylonofritis which becomes sepsis which can kill them very quickly. Exactly. So some people will put Alzheimer's on there that's significant. Some will say Eurosepsis. Yeah, so there's never gonna be great numbers. Alzheimer's is the impetus to death in most patients, for sure. They can't report their pain close to a call on the friend, but he's a patient in the clinic also. Good guy, I've seen his mom, and his mom was just diagnosed with cancer, and she was complaining of a domino pain, something non-specific. She saw a doctor, he actually, oh, he's got dementia, he's got some belly pain. You probably constipated. Here, take some constipation meds, didn't get better, didn't
Starting point is 00:53:09
get better, didn't get better. Turns out she may have pancreatic cancer and she had a gallbladder something and now it's had to put a stent in, right? Only when she turned yellow did they figure out what the cancer was. So Alzheimer's disease dementia causes a person not be able to express themselves and not be able to care for themselves in certain ways and the caregiving has to happen for them. So you see a lot of these aspirations, pneumonia, as you see, you know, my closest friend, one of my closest friends, my roommate in medical school, I just went back to his father's funeral two weeks ago. His father just passed away. He had
Starting point is 00:53:41
Alzheimer's disease, but it was very sudden onset and within the course of eight months his health deteriorated so quickly and ultimately he died from cellulitis, obviously. But you can see that this is someone who probably at the very end was at risk for these things because of all these other changes. And I've also seen people die from just failure to thrive. They have Alzheimer's disease and they just can't eat it. They don't want to eat. They completely lose their appetite. They become anorexic and they be sort of almost drift into a vegetative state where unless you would force feed them, they will die relatively quickly.
Starting point is 00:54:15
But this also strikes me as part of the challenge of trying to get a handle on a disease that has such a ubiquitous face at the end. All-timers disease is a life-course disease. At every moment, someone is either potentially having silent pathology building up. Alzheimer's is a life-course disease, and each phase of life Alzheimer's is a confusing, difficult disease to manage.
Starting point is 00:54:41
In the end of life, it's more obvious, but towards even the beginning of life, you know, people that are born with the 8-Bouye 4 gene, for example, the most commonly researched gene, I'm start off with a smaller brain. So you think of Alzheimer's disease the way I think of cardiovascular disease, which is this disease begins at birth.
Starting point is 00:54:57
Everybody's on a different plane, based on a number of hereditary or acquired risk factors. Your path is not set on that slide. You get to determine it, but your track might be a bit set. Yeah, you know, you asked me before, what's your high risk patient? What does that look like? And I said, it means to be glib, I meant, I just was honest, if someone has a brain, they're at risk for Alzheimer's.
Starting point is 00:55:19
Okay, well, everyone has a brain, so go deeper. Not everyone, technically, I have some counter-factors. Not talking politics, not going there. How did you know that's what I wasn't even going to go there? Excellent. So, moving right along, at every point in the life course, a person's risk may change. So, early life, mid-life, and late life, there's different risk factors for Alzheimer's. And, you know, I agree with you that some people can do everything right and still get Alzheimer's. And you know, I agree with you that some people can do everything right and
Starting point is 00:55:46
still get Alzheimer's. However, based on population attributable risk models, being conservative, one out of every three cases of Alzheimer's disease may be preventable if that person does everything right. Now, the other two out of three cases, well, it may not be preventable. Maybe we can delay it. Could we delay it by two years, three years, five years, six years? I have some hot off the press data. I sent you right before I arrived to send you some new results. So we're trying to hone in on the can we delay it and for how long? But honestly, other people will do everything right and absolutely still get Alzheimer's disease. And I think I understand why now because there's a tug of war going on 100% of the time and it's a tug of war between you and your genes in environment and genes. And when it comes to Alzheimer's, the mnemonic I use is age, age,
Starting point is 00:56:37
age, age, stands for age because age is the number one respect of Alzheimer's. G is genetics, and E is environment. So epigenetics, your interaction between the environment and your genome is going to put you on the path or try to knock you off of the path towards Alzheimer's. And some people can do everything right, but because of their apoi-for-gene, plus another gene or because of their ex-gene or because of their whatever, they're going to get Alzheimer's disease. Other people can modify their environment, modify the impact of their gene on their outcomes, and I believe that it's very reasonable to expect
Starting point is 00:57:15
that one out of three cases of Alzheimer's can be prevented. Because if you can delay Alzheimer's by two, five, or seven, or ten years by doing everything right in that subset, they're going to probably die from something else. Yeah, another thing that I always talk about in the prevention space. I mean, as you know, I take such a hardliner on cardiovascular disease because it is the leading cause of death.
Starting point is 00:57:34
And I believe of the major pillars, atherosclerotic disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease, it's the most preventable. We understand the pathology of that disease so much better than the other two, and we have more tools that seem to have efficacy at preventing that if nothing else, I say it's an adoptionality, time is optionality. And so similarly, if you take somebody who, for whom maybe it is a fate of complete,
Starting point is 00:57:58
that they are going to get Alzheimer's disease, but you say, you know what, instead of getting it at 69, we could make it 78. Well, a lot can happen in nine years. It's not just that you could die of something else, which is maybe better, maybe not depending on what that something else is. But more importantly, maybe you and your peers
Starting point is 00:58:17
have nine extra years to come up with something else. Let's talk about APOE because everybody, you know, I was actually doing and asked me anything yesterday well this is the AMAs and there was a great question about APOE4 and I just punted it because I knew you and I were talking today so I was like, oh, I love the speed round when I can say next. APOE is a gene. It exists mostly in three types though I told there were actually a couple of others, but for the large part there's an Apo E2, an Apo E3, and an Apo E4. Yep, you get one from mom and one from dad, and that way everyone either has a 2, 3, or
Starting point is 00:58:54
a 3, 3, or a 3, 4, or a 4, or 4, or whatever. There are six combinations. The approximate prevalence, the 3, 3s represent probably what about 55, 60%. Yep. You got it. Neutral risk. So we call that unity risk, right? Those are the single risks. The two twos are very rare. I've actually never seen a two two. I've seen one. Okay. They're reported at less than one percent of the population. Maybe two, I think I've seen two.
Starting point is 00:59:16
And they come with a risk reduction, I believe, of about 20 percent. At the far end of the spectrum, you have the four four. Now, that used to be reported as 1% of the population, but I see that so often that I think that's closer to 3 or 4% of the population. You know, in our 600% cohort, we have 37. But you're selecting for high risk. Yeah. I don't select for high risk, but I still feel like it's about 4%.
Starting point is 00:59:41
Yeah. Yeah, and our cohort is like 6%. Now this is interesting. The very first time I started paying attention to ApoE gene, which was about 2011, 2012, the literature said the 4-4 patients relative to the 3-3 patients have a 25-fold increase. Today, we see that number, I think,
Starting point is 00:59:58
continually being downward revised. So for my 4-4 patients, the good news that I have three patients in my practice who are 4-4. The good news for those patients is, look, these numbers are getting better and better. I mean, you and I, I think, offline would agree unofficially. It might be closer to 4-6x. I don't even think you even know optimistic. Well, I'm just going to be frank, Alzheimer's and APOE is confusing. And having two copies of before does absolutely absolutely not mean you're gonna get the disease
Starting point is 01:00:25
and it's a polygenic risk when it comes to the disease. You can have two copies of E4, but never have a family member and never get the disease. I don't believe it's medically correct. It's hard to split hairs or whatever. I don't even think you can say it's 2% or 5% or 20% or whatever percent higher or how many fold, whatever, because you can't know until you know
Starting point is 01:00:51
what the other person's genes are. Yeah, it's very hard to do. And I think the best that people are doing in these large population-based studies is saying acknowledging the heterogeneity of those other risk factors, all things equal. The last paper I read basically said eight to 10x. So again, maybe that's still an overestimate. I believe it is an overestimate,
Starting point is 01:01:11
and I think it's certainly an overestimate with all of the interventions we're gonna talk about. But the point here is, that's a heck of a lot better than a 20 to 25 fold risk. Then you have the three fours. Now they represent quite a bit of people. That's like 20 to 25% of the population. It's all a 25.
Starting point is 01:01:26
Yeah. And our cohort is about 40. Okay. Which again makes sense. You're over-representing. Again, they used to be represented as about a three to four X. I mean, I think today we're saying maybe a two X. Yeah.
Starting point is 01:01:37
Again, notwithstanding your count. Yeah. So polygenic risk. You know, we'll talk about precision medicine and kind of why, what the future of Alzheimer's disease is. And I actually think the future of Alzheimer's disease prevention is now. I don't even think it's the future anymore. I think the future is artificial intelligence, but we can talk about that some other time. The person that walks in with an E3E4, I am actually more optimistic when they come in and less freaked out about the four, because at least I know what I'm up against.
Starting point is 01:02:06
Okay, if that person... Because you have so many three fours in your cohort now. Easy, easy. I know lifestyle interventions work. I am confident that when I do XYZ, ABC, the 27 things that I'll tell them to do based on precision medicine, based on their metabolic risk factors, their cholesterol, their individual risks.
Starting point is 01:02:27
I can predict that they will have a response of this and this is satisfying to me. The problem is when someone comes in with a 3-3, I'm like, uh-oh. Meaning, for a 3-3 to show up in your clinic, by definition, there's a reason. Either their family member had premature Alzheimer's disease and or their potentially even showing early signs of cognitive impairment that are subtle or no. No, I mean, you know, we were prevention clinics. So to get into our clinic, you have to have normal cognitive function with a family history of Alzheimer's. So we focus on the normals. Now, a 3-3 could mean you did not get the 4 for mom or dad and life is beautiful, maybe the risk is lower. But if you have a 3-3 and mom and dad were
Starting point is 01:03:10
a 3-3 and they didn't have the 4, guess what? They probably have another gene and I don't know what that gene is and I don't know what I'm up against. Do you test the parents in that situation? Well, it's tricky. I know a lot of, I would say when I first started the program, most of our prevention patients, so I would program, most of our prevention patients, so I would say 60% of our prevention patients came from the patient with dementia. I was treating, I then saw their kids and their cousins
Starting point is 01:03:33
and whatever else. So, and there's families I see with five, six, seven members, and that's like the best to see, because you can really understand the genotype and phenotypes and see the pattern. I do the same thing with Lp Little A, actually, in the cardiovascular front, which is very helpful, right? It's to be able to say, let's track where this disease
Starting point is 01:03:50
is coming from and see how much of it we can attribute to the genetic influence. So if a patient comes in and they're 3-3, and mom got Alzheimer's disease at 57, and you know that mom is 3-4, you feel a heck of a lot better than if mom is 33 totally Absolutely, and you know we're trying to simplify things and either there's there's with polygenic risk There's dozens of Alzheimer's genes and the goal is is to
Starting point is 01:04:15
Now it's hard because we don't have a neurogeneticist and as I mentioned Holly before and there's practitioner and myself We don't have the team it would take to spend hours and hours and hours and days to decode someone to genome, but in the future hopefully we'll be able to do this in an automated way. But the goal is just to understand, okay, if they have a four, we're going to do A, B, and C. If they don't have a four, we're going to do X, Y, and Z. And I want to come to the study that allowed you to talk about that. Before we go there, we'll round this out. You have two threes and two fours. Two
Starting point is 01:04:45
fours are pretty rare about neutral risk. My cousin's a two four. I've seen two cases, but it's pretty rare. Do we think that the two fours are at increased risk, decreased risk because of the two increased risk because of the four? All things equal, similar, ish to three three, but a little worse. Yeah, that's sort of my thinking. And then the two threes get a benefit, not as much as the two twos. Looks like it's about 11, 10 to 15%. Yeah, I like two threes. Two threes I can really sink my teeth into.
Starting point is 01:05:12
But you must not see many of these people. No, no, I see two threes all the time. Why? They still have risk. They're still coming to you because of family history. Oh yeah, but it's a different gene. There's a different gene in that lurking in there. And we don't know what it is yet.
Starting point is 01:05:24
Yeah, but their polygenic risk is lower because they don't have a for to amplify different gene. There's a different gene in lurking in there. But they're probably genetic risk is lower because they don't have a forward to amplify the gene. The whole family where they came in and they said, oh no, we have early onset Alzheimer's in the family and I said, no, you don't, then it sound like it. And we did all the stuff and mom had E44, uncle had E44, well that's pretty weird, but okay.
Starting point is 01:05:42
Grandparents, I'm sure they had 44, there must have been a lot of fours going on. And then when we look at the kids, they have a three four. Well, we do the three four, but why do they get early disease? What's going on? And we found another gene, a TNF alpha gene. So when you take TNF alpha and you add to a four, well, you're going to have a sixfold risk, that's polygenic risk. That's why they had early times a TNF alpha gene does? What's the phenotype when they have this? Well, you have an inflammatory cascade. It's a pro-inflammatory. Sure. So that's like fast forwarding to Alzheimer's.
Starting point is 01:06:13
Now, when you have a 4-4 and a TNF alpha, that's when you start getting symptoms in your late 40s or 50s. It's not early on-set Alzheimer's disease. What's the gene that is almost a guarantee? Precinelein-1, precinelein- II, and amyloid precursor protein gene mutation. These are three genes that cause true early onset Alzheimer's, meaning you have the gene and you get the disease in your 40s or 50s. Yeah, meaning this is one of the only deterministic genes for AD.
Starting point is 01:06:37
Correct. It's exceedingly rare, less than 1% as an example. I have a 27 year old woman, great gal, she has a pre-Sanielin I gene. How old was she when her mom or dad was diagnosed? Well, her mom's in her early 50s and acting weird, no, and kind of in denial. Her family members ranged from 50s to early 60s. At the time that they were diagnosed? Yep.
Starting point is 01:06:58
But then you take a deep dive into pre-Sanielin I and she actually has a good one from Belgium where they actually have later early onset, meaning like 60, 60. And she's the first person I'd ever seen the prevention clinic who had an early onset gene. And I could not say that she was going to get Alzheimer's. I said, no, I don't know that you will. I think we can do something we have so much time. In the next 20 years for you, I'm not even like worried.
Starting point is 01:07:23
Sure. We'll take care of this. So even, and this is super controversial, but I don't even think one person can say, even having an Alzheimer's gene where you're gonna get the disease, means you're gonna get the disease because the field is changing. Just the field of genetics,
Starting point is 01:07:35
considering that a deterministic gene, they do. There's only about 75 to 100 genes. So there's 20, just for the listener, there's about 20,000 genes in the human genome. Directionally only 100 are deterministic. Polygenic single gene leads to problems. So you have the mutation for cystic fibrosis, you are getting cystic fibrosis, you have the gene for this glycogen storage disease, you are getting it.
Starting point is 01:08:01
Virtually every disease that we think of commonly, of course, does not have a deterministic genome. Certain cancers do, but very few. Virtually all cancers, of course, are somatic mutations and not acquired germline mutations. That's a ballsy thing to say, right? You're saying, look, one percent of Alzheimer's comes from a deterministic gene. I'm not even convinced that's deterministic. It might be an artifact of our GWAS.
Starting point is 01:08:23
Well, no, no, no, no. It's, it's meaning our GWAS is basically never tried in intervention. Correct. Since it's a late, well, it's, it's early means 40s and 50s. But since we have now 30 and 40 years to figure it out, especially in her case, who's 27, and if she doesn't get symptoms for 25 years, I'm loading her up with Kirkgiman. I mean, I got X, Y, and Z. We're going to be putting her in whatever amyloid drug that comes out in the next five to seven years. I mean,
Starting point is 01:08:49
I cannot say that she is going to get it. So, deterministic genes from birth, well, that's a different story. You know, that cystic fibrosis terrible disease, you get it and you have it. Early onset Alzheimer's genes, it's a pretty, you know, No, that's my point. Yeah, I think that when I say artifact of GWAS, I mean, the GWAS is only, so genome-wide association studies, which for the listeners, how we link genes to diseases, it's basically epidemiology of genes. If you study something where a potential treatment for a disease that could have played a role was never introduced, you can actually be misled.
Starting point is 01:09:23
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So, the's basically someone. Yeah. So the other thing I tell my patients, so correct me if I have this right or wrong, is that about two thirds of patients in the US who present with Alzheimer's disease have at least one copy of E4, and about one third of patients do not have a copy of E4,
Starting point is 01:09:40
is that directionally about right? That's probably pretty close. I've always said 6040. I so I guess that's right about the same thing. I'm going to trust you more than I trust me. I don't know. It depends on populations. And so the point you want to make is look about a quarter of the population has an E4
Starting point is 01:09:56
gene, one or two copies, and that quarter of the population makes up two thirds to 60% of the disease. So for my patients who have E4, I say, the good news is, this doesn't mean that your E4 means they're going to get the disease. To my E3 and E2 patients who are busy high-fiving at this point, I say, by the way, the bad news is, not having E4 doesn't mean you are not susceptible to this disease, so you still need to pay attention. I think that individual risk needs to be calculated individually. I said before, oh, three, three, I'm worried. Well, you know, I don't want people who are listening to say,
Starting point is 01:10:32
oh, wait, I thought three through was good. Yes, for the grand vast majority of people, three, three is good. But I need to know what your other genes are. And I take a stupid amount of time doing this through looking at their snips. And this is a, you know, research clinical complicated, takes eight hours of Holly's time, four hours of my time, and then a whole lot of like cerebral, whatever. Or was it looking at Tom 40?
Starting point is 01:10:55
Tom 40 has, we don't have a commercial test that we can test for it. There is a way to do it if we send it somewhere, but we really never went there. We pull it out of Prometheus. Do you guys do that? I may be getting this wrong, but I don't think all... It depends on where the genetic test was done.
Starting point is 01:11:09
And you won't be able to do this out of 23 and me anymore, unfortunately. With through Prometheus? Yeah, you can no longer take 23 and me data into Prometheus and get this degree of fidelity anymore, which thanks FDA if you're listening. Wait, so my understanding of was that the 23Me no longer has an API or like a way to transmit the data, but you can still download the data from 23Me and then re-upload it to Prometheus and still get the same report. Okay, if that's true, that makes me feel better.
Starting point is 01:11:37
We'll confirm that. I hope that's the case. Yeah, we've only done this once for citizen scientists out there. I talked to your doctor and don't do this at home, but one back of the napkin way to Google your genome is to do 23 and me download the data file, upload it to a service like Prometheus, and then basically filter, filter, filter. I mean, we've been working with you and we've come up with basically the SNPs
Starting point is 01:11:59
for everything that we see in the literature that is of high risk, and then we run like kind of an AD panel. It's interesting, we only do this for patients who are E4. I guess we should be doing this for every patient. Family history of AD. Yeah, yeah, exactly, that's a good point. But it's interesting, it speaks to another controversy that we won't get into, which is like information.
Starting point is 01:12:18
I mean, I've been scolded by physicians for measuring ApoE4 and telling a patient that they have an APOE4. I won't go into that. So what is it about APOE4 that's so special? Why is it getting all this attention? I mean, aside from the epidemiology which we've just discussed, what is it doing or not doing that is increasing risk? So APOE plus age higher likelihood of amyloid. Then you add engender. Women plus Epoe plus 65 and over. Much higher likelihood of amyloid. So again, it's a poly, not just a polygenic, but a poly risk, whatever.
Starting point is 01:12:54
It amplifies or increases the likelihood of amyloid deposition. So you just brought up something interesting, which was the question of females. I've always found it hard to believe that the increased risk women see is explained only by their age, meaning their survival advantage over men. Do you, I mean, this, I think I know what my answer is, but I don't want to, what's the term? I'm
Starting point is 01:13:15
going to lead the witness. What is your view for why you think women are at a higher risk than men, all things equal? Well, you know, you can take different roads to Alzheimer's disease. Diabetes will put you in the fast lane and this and that. Women are definitely in the express lane. And why are they in the express lane? I think it has something to do with, and sure, there's something about life course and, you know, having lots of children versus less children, that can impact the two. And there's a whole variety of thinking, and more strut, you know, whatever, to your study you want to read to attribute this, but my feeling is the parimenopause transition has bioenergetic impacts on the brain.
Starting point is 01:13:52
And I believe that Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial base disease, the mitochondria, the battery of the cell, the mitochondria can cause all sorts of bad diseases from Parkinson's to ALS to whatever Huntington's I possibly actually that that's something separate. So long story short, people think of Alzheimer's as amyloid and tau. I think amyloid is the garbage that accumulates and if you don't take the garbage out you're going to get sick, but the upstream effect is mitochondrial dysfunction. And there's something about the mitochondrial bioenergetic pathways.
Starting point is 01:14:25
I'll just talk in generalities because I'm not an expert at this. But I think there's something about the perimenopause transition, the bioenergetic shifts in the brain that are fast forwarding a woman to Alzheimer's disease. So I think it's hormonal. How do we intervene? Meaning you believe that it's the withdrawal of sex hormones that is accelerating the process of either mitochondrial decline or something that is leading to the accumulation of waste product being manifested as amyloid and tau. Yeah, it's brain aging accelerator due to the menopause transition. And that's why I think that we're going with our research and we have a whole
Starting point is 01:15:07
subresearch program to look at this is what is the critical window of opportunity to intervene. Now, how do we intervene? And when are the key questions you intervene before menopause, pairing menopause, when do you intervene? What do you do? What progesterone estrogen should you use a pill or a cream or a patch to use it for two years, two years, five years, seven years, do you have to balance the decision based on breast cancer and other things

that may have blood clots and smoking. So I go by my gut in almost all things medical and can say that my understanding of this is kind of like if I had to use a television analogy maybe we're at the black and white television, but at least we can see a picture and we're not at color and we're not at high depth, but I think that my understanding a picture. We're not at color, we're not at high-deaf, but I think that my understanding is evolving, and I think it has to do with brain bioenergetic pathways and an individual woman's risk versus a man's. Now that's interesting, because you also brought up
Starting point is 01:15:56
Alzheimer's disease has been referred to as type three diabetes or brain diabetes, which of course is also an energetics pathway. So that would suggest that there seemed to be at least two, maybe three or more completely distinct, which is not to say there's no overlap between these, but paths towards the disease, because the other one we didn't even talk about was a vascular path.
Starting point is 01:16:17
Two or three, I think there's like 12 or 16. I mean, I talk because I'm sort of a simpleton on this topic. I generally refer to it as three or four different paths to the same place where you have the same final common pathway. Everybody's accumulating amyloid beta and tau, but you can get there through microvascular disease, which then becomes basically a disease of hypoxia. You can get there through diabetes,
Starting point is 01:16:41
which then becomes an energetic problem. You can get there as you describe through a separate sort of mitochondrial dysfunction. I mean, you could think of a dozen things that could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Among them, the one you describe, which to me strikes me as the Occam's Razor explanation for why women would disproportionately have this difference from men. It is just great paper about this by Shelke and Atia. I've read it. It's great. You know, there was this great paper about this by Shelke and Natia. I've read it.
Starting point is 01:17:05
Great. You know, there was an interesting paper Richard about three years ago. It was a very small paper. I don't even remember how many women were in it, but I remember it was surprisingly small. And it was, if I recall, also heterogeneous in ApoE type. And it asked the question, if you took these women who were either paramanopausal or early menopausal, and you treated them with HRT, did you improve cognitive performance? If I believe the result of that study was you
Starting point is 01:17:33
did only in the women that had an E4 gene, but not in the woman that did not, to which my interpretation was, maybe you were just underpowered to detect a difference in the non-E4s, But because the E4s come with another risk You didn't need that many women to see the benefit So is it your practice today in the clinic to use hormone replacement therapy in perimenopausal women? Yeah, this is a tricky one You know, I know what I know and I know what I don't know and I have a very specific scope of practice I've never prescribed statins. I've never I don't't treat cholesterol per se, although actually thanks to you and others,
Starting point is 01:18:05
I've learned a lot about plant sterols versus zedian. I'll make tacit suggestions, and I'll use omega-3s, and that kind of thing with cholesterol. Same thing with hormones, I would never prescribe. Do you have physicians that you, that are willing to work alongside you in these areas? I mean, I have preventative cardiologists at BCI,
Starting point is 01:18:23
I have primary care doctors that I can see eye to eye with. I have one reproductive endocrinologist in Texas who we see eye to eye and we speak the same language. I don't really have an endocrinologist or a hormone doctor that I can refer patients to where we can have cogent conversations because I think the area is just so hazy, the level of evidence is so hazy and I'll just tell you my You said apoi for and may have something to do with I also think metabolic status is something to do with this Roberta Brinton has looked at you know women with Vascular wrist so high cholesterol diabetes, you know high blood sugar Whatever that maybe those patients are the one that respond preferentially to harm and replacement therapy
Starting point is 01:19:01
But there's a lot of precision medicine in here that is very hazy. That being said, my kind of off-the-shelf answer would be women early on in the parimenopause transition for the first two, five, maybe seven years, hormone replacement, maybe a good idea. I just, and probably is a good idea, but I just don't know if you need to take a pill, which pill, what ratio of what to what and is a cream probably better. I may geared towards the latter, but I actually just don't know. There's a study with Albert Pregnantalone,
Starting point is 01:19:32
which I think is gonna be very interesting. So I just... I have strong feelings about this. So we're gonna go have dinner after this. We're gonna talk for probably two hours, just about this topic. This is a huge passion of mine. And I know what's happening right now. Someone's listening to this and they're going to talk for probably two hours just about this topic. This is a huge passion of mine. I know what's happening right now.
Starting point is 01:19:48
Someone's listening to this and they're going, wait, just tell us the answer. No, I don't want to jump on my soap box about this because I want to come back to talking about this. You alluded to one of the most interesting things in your clinic. I don't know. Are we, is the manuscript submitted so that I'm talking about the matrix of MTHFR by APOE, BioMarker versus Cognitive thing? That, is that submitted yet published?
Starting point is 01:20:10
We literally have, so just give you a brief snapshot. We started the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in 2013, took about a year and a half, just under two years to get the IRB approvals and get all their ducks in a row with getting the cognitive assessments, the IRB approved and whatever. So since March of 2015, less three and a half years in change, we've been recruiting patients into a registry where we basically follow patients across primary prevention, secondary prevention and tertiary prevention of Alzheimer's disease dimension. I can define those in a minute. So when we have this data, we are deep, deep, deep in the data analysis phase, and we literally
Starting point is 01:20:46
have no joke over a thousand pages of results, data tables, graphs, and I've only scratched the surface. So let's explain the intervention. Taking a step back, you're saying, look, we're going to stratify patients by four things. One, genetics. And the genes you looked at were apoe and MTHFR. Can you say a little bit about MTHFR for the listener? MTHFR is confusing when I started the program. I thought MTHFR was a whole bunch of whatever. And now I don't believe that anymore. MTHFR
Starting point is 01:21:16
is methyl tetrahedral, folate, reductase gene, something like that. MTHFR, if you have multiple mutations. Do you know how many patients have come to me and said on their test, when they look at MTHFR, they're like, why does it say mother fucker? I'm like, no, actually, it's methyl tetra. Exactly. So it's quite an interesting gene. You can Google and find all sorts of stuff out there.
Starting point is 01:21:37
But MTHFR does have a role in Alzheimer's risk. But to me, it is, you know, you can take different roads to Alzheimer's. It's one of those roads. It's a metabolic road through homocysteine. I mean, is that what your hypothesis is? Exactly. And basically methylation detoxification, you know, whatever word you want to use. I don't love using these words because it's just very hazy. But if you have multiple mutations, two mutations in one of your main MTHFR genes, the 677 gene.
Starting point is 01:22:05
You know, and this is the back of the napkin, I'm not sure if this is technically correct, but just for listeners, the person may have problems or be inefficient at metabolizing B vitamins, and because of that, they're in the downstream cascade of biochemistry, homocysteine goes up and it's a marker for something not working efficiently and well in detoxifying whatever you want to say. When it comes to anti-HFR, homocysteine in people with Alzheimer's risk, this is precision medicine, where if someone has an elevated homocysteine, but they're treated with B vitamins, they can slow overall brain atrophy and improve memory. However, that will only work if you have optimized omega-3 fatty acids, So this precision component of understanding the person's individual biology is necessary
Starting point is 01:22:49
because if you don't have high-helmet system, you probably don't need this stuff. You probably don't need B complex vitamins. So in this case, MTHFR is helpful in terms of looking at the gene because if someone is taking the regular B vitamins, if you look on a B12, it says cyanocobalamine. If you look at folic acid, it says folic acid. We're giving the person extra folic acid in cyanocobalamine, we're giving them the B vitamins, but their homocystins not coming down,
Starting point is 01:23:14
and they may need a more metabolically active form. And there's different race-mic mixtures, and there's different biochemical blah, blah, blah, that we can talk about in different forms and different companies that make it. Actually, the company that I use for my practice, you told me about it because literally reliably I said, that little bottle and the yellow bottle works. It always works.
Starting point is 01:23:33
It absolutely always works. So you can do the prescription version and that actually probably always works too. It's a little more expensive but it definitely always works. So I'm going around the block to get across the street because it's complicated, but when a person is not responding to traditional B vitamins, I will then step it up and give them methyl cobalanine B12 and methyl folic, whatever folic acid, methyl tetrahydrofolate, whatever version of folic acid. And the combination, that is usually enough to get the home assisting down. So this is a nice example of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics in our Alzheimer's prevention practice. And I think the table or the image that you're
Starting point is 01:24:14
preferring to is when we basically take all of our patients and we map different people with different genes, do they respond to different things? That's right. It's every the X-axis would be, or the top of the table would be each of the APOE combinations. So here's all six of them. And then each of the MTHFR combinations, there's two genes, four combos per gene, so eight of those. And then it's basically in response to the lifestyle intervention program, where did we see an improvement
Starting point is 01:24:43
along which biomarkers and or which element of cognitive testing. But I guess just to be clear, we're not going to be able to show that table here, that's not yet published. Right. Oh no, no, I mean, that's on page 700 to 900, yeah. So you know, the first paper that we got accepted. I'd show that to patients all the time, but I mean, that poster is great. Yeah, that's a poster we presented last year, but you have to put the cart before the
Starting point is 01:25:03
horse or whatever that's saying is. But first you have to get the methods paper published. And this is pretty amazing that we got this published in the Alzheimer's and dementia journal, Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. And this is currently available just recently published. Yeah, we'll link to anything and everything that you let us. My primary care doctor, who you got to meet in Miami,
Starting point is 01:25:20
this guy, Dr. Wolf, you guys are like two peas in a pod. He basically said, oh, this is your manifesto. Like that's not my manifesto, it's just, you know, you guys are like two peas in a pod. He basically said, oh, this is your manifesto. Like that's not my manifesto. It's just, you know, whatever, but he called it the manifesto. It's 11,000 words of everything you need to know about how to manage a patient for Alzheimer's prevention. And we've created a free... And that will be accepted in one journal article.
Starting point is 01:25:36
It's 3,000 words, 3,500 words in the main thing, and then we have all the rest in the appendices. Yep, and I can't believe it, but it was all accepted and it took seven months. But basically, we've actually since this is hard to read an 11,000 word article, we've actually created a free online CME course for physicians basically using this. Well, that'd be ready by November. Yeah, so ailsu.org. So we'll make sure we absolutely link to that. Is there value in there for patients as well? So ailsU.org is a free site that is for the public. So for the late public, if you want to learn everything, about what is and what is not in our control about Alzheimer's disease, ALZU.org is a completely free site
Starting point is 01:26:14
to learn about everything. Then there's the healthcare provider page. If you go to the little healthcare provider tab and you type in your information, you can then enroll in the healthcare provider course and actually receive a CME credit for it. So there's actually a valuable CME course out there. Like are they not the most useless idiotic things on the face of the earth?
Starting point is 01:26:30
Okay, not the way I think it is. I mean once you're all you find a gem like this. Hey, yeah. Every time I do a CME course on nutrition, I have to deliberately answer the questions incorrectly to pass the test. Right, yeah, it's CME is one of those things. We've tried to really use CME to RFI because no one knows about this stuff. Doctors just don't know that.
Starting point is 01:26:49
Well, that's great. You know, we're trying to get the word out. We got the methods paper out. That's done. Explaining the internet. And let's explain it sort of at a high level. The intervention is a lifestyle intervention that is multimodal. Patients are stratified, as I said, by genetics.
Starting point is 01:27:02
So you have an MTHFR, APOE. You also have an anthropometric. We try to keep it simple. So the ABCs of Alzheimer's prevention management, it sounds kitschy, but I really think ABCs actually fit. So A is anthropometric. We look at body fat, we look at lean mass, we look at visceral fat.
Starting point is 01:27:18
Where is the fat? I learned a lot of this stuff. We really take a deep dive. It's not just about weight and BMI. That's just like the worst. No, it's about body fat. Where's the fat metabolic, reactive, yada yada. Then the B is for biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers,
Starting point is 01:27:32
specifically cholesterol markers, especially the deeper dive. I just want to take my hat off to you, Richard. You do more detailed lipid profiling than most cardiologists do. I remember the first time I sat down with you, I was fully expecting you to just whip out like the LDL, HDL, triglycerides are this.
Starting point is 01:27:50
And you went deep, I mean, you had APOB, you had LDLP, you had particle subtype, you really got into it and I was like, why is the neurologist knowing all of this stuff when every cardiologist seems to like still be in the dark ages on this. That drives me crazy. It's interesting, we have four cardiologists now
Starting point is 01:28:08
in the practice, actually one who listens to the podcast, give him a shout out, she probably shouldn't say his name, but what's up? Really great, I actually, he's been a great patient, but he's been a mentor and a teacher to me too. And we have cardiologists in the practice, and one is like totally anti, like what are you ordering? And he's still anti all that stuff,
Starting point is 01:28:26
but he really wants to know his numbers. And he really wants me to interpret it. But for his patients, you know, I don't use this stuff. What are some of the other biomarkers you focus on? So the forming categories are cholesterol, but deep dive cholesterol. Inflammation, however, there's just four inflammation labs and they're just not great, but it's just in our panel.
Starting point is 01:28:41
So what are you looking at besides CRP and Fibrinogen? Do you look at IL-1 or IL-6, TNF? Yeah, I wish. Baby steps. It's myeloproxidase and LPPLA2, which I don't exactly know what to do with, but yeah, Fibrinogen, interesting and high-sensity CRP. Now that I see all the results in our outcomes, HSCRP is probably the most informative, but something like myeloproxidase is a risk factor for
Starting point is 01:29:07
vascular cognitive impairment later. That's a new study. So I don't exactly know what to do with inflammatory markers, but we're checking them. And what stands in the way of adding some inner lukins to that? Some of the money, Benjamin's. I would love to get better nutritional biomarkers, which we'll talk about. We do it in the serum. We absolutely need to do it in the red blood cell, but we need to send it to a different place in a different FedEx account. This is the thing. I'm just gonna get back on my soapbox, Goddamn it.
Starting point is 01:29:31
I'm allowed to do this, I guess. This is the one perk of having your show. If you're listening to this, and you're in some way touched by Alzheimer's disease, either because you have a family member who's got it or you're concerned about anything like that, and you're considering funding research in Alzheimer's disease, I can't emphasize enough the importance of
Starting point is 01:29:47
funding the type of research that Richard does, whether that means funding Richard directly or somebody else because Alzheimer's prevention is so underfunded, it is an embarrassment to this disease state. And I've had patients who have said to me, you know, a loved one just passed away and I'd like to throw $100,000 at something for Alzheimer's research. And I think to myself, luckily those patients like to give that money to you,
Starting point is 01:30:10
because you can do more with $100,000 in your clinic. And immediately. $100,000 doesn't buy you five animals to do a study on a drug that has a 99.6% chance of not working. Let me repeat that. The success rate of pharmacology for Alzheimer's disease is 0.4%. In other words, 99.6 of drugs brought forth to treat Alzheimer's disease are abject failures. Now, if you are interested in the philanthropic side of Alzheimer's disease
Starting point is 01:30:41
and you want to put more money in that pot, you must ask yourself the question, which is, and then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money.
Starting point is 01:31:00
And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then you're going to get a lot of money. And then's funny, like, if I would have had $75,000 more three years ago, I would have had the right biomarkers, so I could definitively say about which omega-3, which this, which that I could have for $75,000, you know, we've gone through $8 million in five years. Okay, it's not too bad actually. I mean, for a major research program, five million of it philanthropy, three million NIH and other grants,
Starting point is 01:31:28
$75,000 extra, I could have definitive evidence about which omega-3s to take is it ALA, DHA EPA. I think it's DHA and EPA, but I wasn't doing the right biomarkers, because I couldn't afford the right test. So for the littlest tiny investments, we have a data set with 3000 pieces of data on every patient. We have such a deep phenotypic characterization. I have thousands of pages of data.
Starting point is 01:31:51
I don't know how I'm going to write this up. I need to hire two full-time people for $50,000 per person. We can turn out papers, you know, two papers every few months. So the take-home point is in an imprecise world, an imperfect world where I don't have unlimited funds, we have to be cautious. So we've done the best we can. But oh man, I wish if we could have TNF Alphan or Lukens and CD50s and I wish we could do that. Yeah, and I think the way to think about this, again, if you're listening to this and you're trying to understand how should funding be allocated, you have to think about this as how would you hedge, right? So I'm not suggesting for a moment that no effort should be made at doing research around Alzheimer's treatment.
Starting point is 01:32:29
I mean, the disease is devastating and you don't have to meet but one person who suffers from this disease to think we should be throwing heaven and earth at figuring out how to treat these patients. The question is how would you balance that portfolio? Because right now that portfolio is about 99 to 1.99.9 dollars are going into treatment, point one dollars going into prevention. I'm asking simply what if it were 90, 10? What if it were 90 dollars that go into treatment and 10 dollars into prevention? In reality, I think if it were 10, 90, we'd move the needle even more if we were willing to acknowledge that, hey, a lot of people can't be helped right now, which is an awful message to consider.
Starting point is 01:33:08
So anyway, I do think that prevention suffers from a number of things. It's waist squishier. There's always going to be a bias against the idea that you can get people to change behaviors, lifestyle behaviors. In other words, it's one thing to get a patient to take their pill. It's quite another thing to get a patient to change the way they sleep, the way they meditate, if they do it all, the way they exercise, the way they eat. These things are harder to do.
Starting point is 01:33:33
That's the downside. The upside is, if you can do those things, I think the evidence is pointing to, you can have a much bigger impact. Oh, yeah. And when you do this precision medicine approach where you look at their cholesterol, inflammation, metabolism, we'll talk about in a second nutrition biomarkers, genetics, and you take all these factors and you look at their body fat and you look at their cognitive function, which we'll talk about, the A, Bs, and Cs.
Starting point is 01:33:55
You can then give them a personalized precision medicine plan and they end up getting that right plan and then the outcome is better and then they're going to have positive reinforcement where they're going to keep doing it. I have people that I haven't been able to lose weight my whole life. Are you doing the wrong thing? You're on elliptical for 20 minutes three times a week. That's not going to get you to lose weight that may get you to maintain yourself a little bit, but not really you need to do high-intensity interval training. You need to lose body fat. Here's your fat. Here's your this. here's your that, when you attack it with knowledge about
Starting point is 01:34:27
the non-one size fits all approach and the N of one do everything and everything based on your individual biology and genetics, that's when a person can have the most success. When they have success, it's positive reinforcement. Yeah, and I think seeing those biomarkers improve, I saw three patients today in clinic and in all cases were we're reviewing labs,
Starting point is 01:34:46
and it's really, I love it. Yeah, they really like to be able to, especially the ones that dial into this stuff that think, oh wow, look at how this change led to that, but not this, and what do I need to do more here? And I mean, I guess in the end, one of the challenges is you and I both have a luxury that not a lot of doctors do,
Starting point is 01:35:03
which is we have small practices that allow us that luxury of time. And so hopefully some of these other tools you're developing will allow physicians to be able to scale themselves a little bit by saying, look, I, you know, Dr. Smith might not have as much time as Dr. Isaacson to sit down and spend an hour with each patient going over this stuff, but I can at least point
Starting point is 01:35:24
a patient to a tool that can help streamline this process. When I'm sleeping without any PR, without any other thing, just because the way the internet works, when I go to sleep and wake up, my ex-girlfriend with the phone thing, who I was trying to show off and impress, she said, well, you work so much,
Starting point is 01:35:40
and every time you get a lecture, you're okay, fine, but make money while you're sleeping. Well, it's the same thing. I want to help people and educate people. I'm sleeping. You're ready. I see seven patients in a day, sometimes five, because it takes a lot of time. But when I'm sleeping over a thousand patients are on that free education website with two hours of interactive educational content about Alzheimer's prevention, that's how we impact lives. So I'm hoping that we can increase that from a thousand to 8,600 patients while you're sleeping. I would get the reference to that.
Starting point is 01:36:10
So does my pocketbook, absolutely. And it's everything's free, and we don't charge for any of this stuff, but that was an inside joke. So I guess as we go back to the A, Bs and Cs, so the other biom blood biomarkers that we could probably wax poetic and talk about for another several hours is metabolism because I believe Alzheimer's disease isn't metabolic disease in the vast majority of cases. And we look at, again, we can talk about this for an hour. Is that becoming a mainstream view yet?
Starting point is 01:36:32
I mean, that was such an out there view six, seven years ago. Is it less out there now? It's hard to ignore the fact that patients with type two diabetes have a disproportionate risk. What the amyloidocentric people in the Tauis, the amyloid and Tau people, the Tauis, I mean that's a sweet title. That is cool, right?
Starting point is 01:36:49
I would like to be a Tauis. I call it amyloidocentric, but other people say the Baptist, Baptist means Bapinus amab, which is an anti-amyloid drug. Anyway, the Baptist, Tauis, whatever, I'm a mitochondrialist or whatever it is. What I would say is those people that don't get it,
Starting point is 01:37:04
most people don't understand that the leaders in the Alzheimer's field that are like leading major initiatives like two of the most major initiatives in Alzheimer's disease, one is led, actually both are led by non-clinical physicians that have never seen an Alzheimer's patient. Soapox rant number two coming up now, this should be a good time to hit forward by two minutes if you don't want to hear the rant.
Starting point is 01:37:27
You know, a few things chap my ass more than the leaders in the field treating clinical diseases who don't treat patients. And I often get asked, like, do you one day see yourself not actually practicing medicine but instead just focusing on the types of research and collaborative things that you're going to do? And the answer is always no. The day you stop seeing patients is the day you stop getting humbled by and reminded of what the hell you do this for. And what you just said is staggering. Yeah, I would not have guessed that. When I found out this one person had no clinical training and basically did some radiology Trash
Starting point is 01:38:05
I don't want to talk about specifics, but in the other person like a related kind of field but not psychiatry not Geriatrics like not the traditional anything Drives you crazy and then and then you have this conversation with them or you say oh, hey nice to meet you And they say I heard about you. You give me the scowl. They give me that scowl At least they're saying now because you you're such a low life neurologist who's like on the ground actually touching these patients. Yeah, when I heard about you, you're that guy, or you know, prevention, or at least they're saying
Starting point is 01:38:36
multiple shots on goal. Maybe we need to look at other targets aside from hemloid and towel. That's at least what they're saying. All right, we'll take that's progress. I'll take it and the tomatoes are getting thrown at me less and less which is good So let's go back to the town for a guy who doesn't cook This is a highly inefficient use of tomatoes like if someone threw a bunch of tomatoes at me
Starting point is 01:38:53
I could make some nice sauce yeah Turn on my oven once and that was in 2001 before you started storing your Text books or that was in 2001 I started putting my textbooks in there because I had no room in Boston I actually I've put my textbooks and other things in my oven for a long time I live in a tiny apartment. I have two dogs two cats a guy in the couch is a problem Guys got here venting and I talked to my therapist I'm trying to figure out why your fiance hasn't moved to New York yet. I wonder why yeah
Starting point is 01:39:20
I have no insight into and they guys got a long hair. Oh no, she's in California. She's in California Yeah, one of those things we have a bike hostel dog cat whatever guy in the couch definitely got to go by the time She comes back. He's he listening to this. No, he's not a podcast listener. So there's no risk that he's gonna be offended by the fact that you said he's got to go No, no, I don't have to cut that part out. No, no, he's got long hair. The hair is everywhere. It's just like so messy Anyway, back to metabolism the metabolism. What are you measuring metabolism? Do you do or glucose tolerance test? Well Dr. Peter Atia has schooled me on this more than one time and I would love to however we can only do it You don't have the bunch as we can do. Yeah, and the time and the trickiness
Starting point is 01:40:02
But sure I'm not doing everything as precise as I need to. And you know, you're the one that's taught me about how, you know, you can have fluctuations and sugar up and down. But then the average hemoglobin A and C is normal, but you're missing those other things. So, so we, we do it better than maybe the average Joe, but we look at hemoglobin A and C. We look at home IR. We look at fasting insulin. We look at fasting blood glucose, which I really like even though it's in precise It just does give me a good snapshot. We look at adiponectin which is confusing sometimes So you know, these are some of the mate. We used to look at more things and then it was expensive So we do the best we can but then we triangulate so the key here in the
Starting point is 01:40:40
Are there any other classes of biomarkers? Oh, sorry nutrition nutrition. Yes, we look at this specifically in the ABC classes of biomarkers. Oh, sorry. Nutrition. Nutrition, yes. And what do you look at there specifically? Um, this is our problem because we look at saturated fat monounsaturated fat, DHA, EPA, ALA, you know, all this sorts of stuff. Based on what food frequency question yours?
Starting point is 01:40:54
No, no, in the blood. Oh, you're measuring RBC levels of all of these. No, that's the problem. We're measuring serum levels. It's a problem. Oh, yeah, that's a problem. I know. That's a tour. Oh yeah, that's a problem. I know. I had that toward killer discussion.
Starting point is 01:41:05
That's hence my $75,000, whatever that got sucked away back in 2013. Oh, that was 2015. We had money for this and then things happened sometimes. So what's the C? The C is as important as the A and the B. And I never would have said this five years ago, or even thought that I would be talking about something this ridiculous but C is cognitive function.
Starting point is 01:41:28
That doesn't sound ridiculous. Well, well, using cognitive function to personalize or individualize a person's care from a biological perspective, that sounded ridiculous to me five years ago, but we look at processing speed, attention, memory, executive function, all these different cognitive domains, when I see lipids, I now see executive function. I see vitamin D and homocysteine. I say, hmm, could that be processing speed? When I see metabolism problems and high visceral body fat, that's screaming memory, metabolism
Starting point is 01:41:58
and memory. What we do... So this is news to me. Like, I didn't do it. Oh, me too. Yeah. And what we do, so this is news to me like I didn't oh me too. Yeah, so are you seeing this as is this just basically? A blind squirrel has found some nuts like you're just digging through your data and these patterns are emerging No, not that. No, this is clinical. This is clinical observation
Starting point is 01:42:16
That's what I mean, because you're still generating clinical data Yeah, this is pre data analysis and you know some of the data analysis doesn't even hold up with maybe my clinical observations Because people are different and when you lump Bob and Jim and whoever else together all in a bunch. So these are just very loose sort of observations that are becoming now testable hypothesis. Right. And the testable hypothesis are tricky here because what we do is more traditional statistics. We do your means and averages and you know, all the fancy least squares means and whatever Bayesian, Yadda, Yadda, but we probably need to be doing N of one studies. And N of one is a way to...
Starting point is 01:42:50
Which can't bring us back to AI. Yeah. I mean until you have the AI engine to choose. Totally. And I was a computer door in a past lifetime and I would do artificial intelligence with my life. If I had a billion dollars tomorrow, I would fund my research and get the right people on the bus to do all the things I want to do, and I would focus professionally on programming and artificial intelligence, because
Starting point is 01:43:08
that's how we can really beat this stuff. That's in the same getting in my rant or my, that was my soapbox time. But long story short is, end of one people where you can make these associations, and you average it all together and the cohort and it gets too hazy, but metabolism and memory. Metabolism and learning and memory specifically. And what we do here, and this is the key, triangulating on the a's, the b's, and the c's. So never say, oh, your blood sugar fasting is 97. You need to do X, Y, or Z differently. Nin-Nin-Nin-Nin-Nah.
Starting point is 01:43:39
97, that's above 95, and that's my cutoff of normal for brain health, memory, and cognitive function, which is less than the 100 cutoff Which in med school it was 125 and then 116 in residency and now it's 100 and hopefully in five years will be 95 I don't know what you think a fasting blood sugar is appropriate in terms of a reference range But for brain health, I think it's 95 based on some work from Germany So what we do is we take the a's to be in the seas we triangulate the information only then Do you make a clinical decision. And you can't just treat based on one, you have to interpolate everything. And when you do that, that's when you can come up with the clinical precision medicine plan. So what cutoff sure you're using on your lipids these days?
Starting point is 01:44:19
Let's just go with LDL particle. Oh gosh, this is confusing because I don't want to talk about bimodal curves and maybe people with too high L, HDLs can be bad. And I mean, there's a lot of complexity here and it's an individual. And this is a phenotype thing. Like I just C-TEP, C-E-T-P, cholesterol, ester, transfer, whatever. I don't know what that gene is called,
Starting point is 01:44:38
but I can see that the person has the gene because I can feel it in my gut and I can look at the labs and I can just see. Based on their HDL cholesterolL cholesterol you mean or the combination of their HDL particle and their HDL cholesterol and size. It's really hard for me to give generality is because there are certain people where the rules don't apply or the rules apply backwards. So LDL cutoff, shorts, absolutely below 100, I'd love below 70. What about in the particle? Sub 1000, but 600, 500, better than 800 or 900 maybe, but I don't really know for sure And are you concerned that statin use even though at the population level statin use is always associated with a lower risk of dementia that
Starting point is 01:45:17
In certain individuals it can exacerbate it. I hate to say this, but yes, and five years ago I would have said heck no statin should be in the drinking water. I'm very pro statin, period. Just like you said, population-based, I'm very pro statin. Because of this clinical observation where you see patient after patient after patient, you see genotype and then phenotype and whatever, I do believe that different statins work differently in different people. I think there's a gender difference. I think when in doubt, low dose is better. I think people with apoi-four genes, especially two apoi-four genes, holy cow, you have to be careful. I think you were the one that talked about live-alow, and then I learned more about, you know,
Starting point is 01:45:55
crestor and hypotency and low potency and lipophilic and blah, blah, blah. You know, and how a torvastatin showed to be beneficial in men with slowing hippocampal atrophy, but not in women. And, you know, and I've just seen men change from one cholesterol drug to another, because, hey, their numbers look great, but now their memory got worse. High potency statin, apoi-four, maybe we need to come down a little bit.
Starting point is 01:46:16
So I am pro statin, period. And I think I'm pro statin. Let me just say that. But I'm anti-1 size fits all. Yeah, I mean, I think this is one of those things in medicine that I think is very hard for people to understand, which is how can something like a stat and potentially be good and potentially be bad. And the reality of it is it can be very positive from a vascular standpoint, can be positive
Starting point is 01:46:40
from an inflammatory standpoint. It could be negative from a cholesterol biosynthesis standpoint in a susceptible individual. And so, I mean, like you, I consider myself pro everything under the right conditions. I'm pro hammers when I have a nail and a piece of wood, but I'm pro phillips screwdriver when I have a phillips screw and a piece of drywall. Perfect. Yeah, that's a great point. So, and there's plant steriles zeti and this and that and omega-3s and I like omega-3s to get down. And you mentioned earlier on the omega-3 front, I mean I think in the last year and a half, actually during the time when we were writing that manuscript I think it became a little
Starting point is 01:47:15
bit more clear that it might even be the DHA. And it works better in E4s, but it just takes years to work. To have the most robust, two and a half years I think to recycle the amount of DHA in a person's brain. So when you study it for six months, then you're only getting 20% of the effects. I'm sorry to do that. I'm sorry to do that. Brand number three soapbox, again, when someone says such and such an agent was studied and it had no effect, should you immediately dismiss the intervention, only if you can be confident
Starting point is 01:47:43
that it was, that it was studied correctly correctly and that the time course of the disease and the intervention were appropriately matched. And it's that latter point that almost always seems to be the missing link. And that's a great example of that. Frankly, half the primary prevention studies in disease, I think miss the mark because they don't understand the time course of the disease that's being studied. And the other part about this is, you know, if you do this one size fits on, you give say omega-3s to everybody, but people with high omega-3s maybe don't need it, but then they lump the results together.
Starting point is 01:48:13
Well, guess what? The study's going to be negative. Maybe you should have just given you omega-3s to the people that actually need it, and that would have been your enrollment criteria, then your outcome would have been different. So precision medicine in this whole one size fits all thing, it's just very dichotomy. So yeah, we take these ABCs and we generate evidence based and safe from patient education. You know, two hours more online, interactive education online for free, patient counseling with me and Holly.
Starting point is 01:48:41
And then we really type out a whole plan. And this is four pages, five pages, and 10 pages. So in which patients not to get too tactical, but I know that a lot of people listening to this are probably chopping up a bit to know some of the things, I mean, we've alluded to a number of these things now. Another one that's really come on my radar in the last two years is a specific type of curcumin
Starting point is 01:49:00
called Thericumin. Can you talk a little bit about what that is, how it works and why? Sure, and I have nothing to disclose. I did a medscape piece on Theric human. Can you talk a little bit about what that is, how it works and why? Sure, and I have nothing to disclose. I did a medscape piece on Theric human, and man, I got tomatoes thrown at me in the comments section. This one, ER doctor and Kansas, hopefully, he's not listening to this, actually called him.
Starting point is 01:49:15
Oh, hopefully he is listening. Yeah, well, I actually called him to discuss in the secretary in the ER said, all right, I mean, I'll give you, blah, blah, blah, whatever, out. But, you know, I have nothing to disclose, and I don't so supplement it. I don't have a supplement company on the side.
Starting point is 01:49:27
No, I wish. I have hundreds of thousands of student loans. My fiance has 450,000 student loans. I have a recommendation. If you could start monetizing your bling phones, there might be a way to start putting a dent in those things. This is a very unique audience as interested in these though. So I'd have to spend money to find that person
Starting point is 01:49:45
If you know any oligarchs, that's what usually yeah If you can find a Chinese billionaire I have a Chinese phone You have that Chinese phone and then this white alligator skin one So we want to part with this so you wrote this thing in medscape about their acumen Yeah, and I got and I was trying to sell things right listen just just for disclosure I wish but I've made a conscious decision not to. I live in a one-bedroom apartment with two dogs, two cats and a guy in the couch. It's my bathroom is the size of a closet.
Starting point is 01:50:12
I live in New York City. I have tons of loans. I am negative when it comes to my networks since moving to New York five years ago. I don't need a sob story. I have a roof over my head. I'm very fortunate, whatever, but I am not trying to make money. I'm not trying to sell stuff. So, although I probably should. I'm very fortunate, whatever, but I am not trying to make money. I'm not trying to sell stuff So although I probably should not I'm not selling my phone though So when it comes to Theric Herman
Starting point is 01:50:30
It is a specific type that comes from Japan and this Japanese company from my understanding I'm basically made this nanoparticle small particle version now There are versions of Kyrkumen that may be optimized for absorption and blah blah blah But in the all-time research study by John Ringman and colleagues, when they did a randomized study on curriculum for mild to moderate Alzheimer's, the study was negative, but when they did the blood samples, the curriculum was being swallowed and not being absorbed in the blood.
Starting point is 01:50:57
So I wonder why curriculum didn't work. So this basically led to this Japanese company putting together this ferric-curement version, nanoparticles, whatever it is, and a study by Gary Small and colleagues basically showed that after 18 months of using it when you look at PET scans There was less amyloid in the group that got the real Optimize. So does that mean we should be using Theric human even in our non-high-risk AD patients that we would otherwise be giving Curcumin to precision medicine. No one size fits also. Sorry to get back on that soap box. But no, not everyone I don't think needs curcumin.
Starting point is 01:51:30
I think it depends on what their ABCs are. You know, if they have some inflammatory stuff, well, I'm not checking the right inflammatory stuff. So I can't use that as a biomarker. If they have some memory stuff, well, maybe, if they're at higher risk and they have any before gene, maybe. What was the dose of their accumacuminin that small study? Well, small meaning the author, not the size.
Starting point is 01:51:48
Yeah, it's two pills a day. It's just like 500, 600 maybe. I just, it's two pills a day, read the label, read the study I'm forgetting, but it's one pill a day for a week. And there are several companies that sell Theracuminin now or just one. Several companies, yeah. So again, I'm not vouching for any brand, but as you said earlier, Peter, you know, you taught me which methyl yacht, yacht it's to use and it works every time and it's like
Starting point is 01:52:09
finally we have a good version of I do vouch for that. Yeah, for the listener, the brand that we've switched to across the board is Jero's. They have a combined lozons that's methyl folate and methyl B12. Yeah, the yellow bottle, but yeah, little yellow bottle with the pink lozons. So, you know, we choose specific supplements because we know that they work and they're verified. And, you know, we've used them and we can see it jumping in the blood so we know it works. Thericurement is, they're a human, even not a pronounce it. I don't think everyone needs to be on it, but I do think if you're going to be on it and
Starting point is 01:52:39
you have amyloid in your brain, you better be on the right stuff. So that's important. Should someone take more, I have no idea, I've never told someone to take more, but I have this family that's too multiple to actually two families, three, that have the gap we for gene, and the TNF alpha gene,
Starting point is 01:52:53
well how does curcumin work? They're on the TNF alpha pathway. What we've been doing is then we can add additional labs that cost money, but you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. And we look at CD50 and other inflammatory markers and TNF and while TNF isn't really changing, for example, in multiple patients that we put on this therapeutic treatment, the CD50s increasing. So I don't exactly know what that means, but I do know that their memory is not getting worse and maybe hopefully over time will get better.
Starting point is 01:53:18
So has anybody commented on this rise in CD50? I've never really talked about it before. I mean, you've sent me these data, but is there anything in the literature about CD50? I'm not aware. My brain can only hold so many things. I'm a one-third preventative cardiologist when I shouldn't be, and I have a great guy, Randy Cohen, the bless his heart.
Starting point is 01:53:37
He's just been, I email him, and he emails you back at 48 hours. I have this phone, a friend list of people that are way smarter than me, but I'm one know, I'm one third preventive cardiologist, make believe one. I'm one third neurologist and one third primary care doctor and I just can't internalize all this stuff. So I email you and I have this like group of like 12 to 15 inches that just help me for free and it's amazing.
Starting point is 01:53:58
So don't know what to say. What do you think of as kind of like the five most important things you tell a person? So let's say you're at a cocktail party and someone finds out what you do for a living. By the way, when I'm at a cocktail party, if I'm ever asked what I do, there are only two responses. I sell carpet or sofa beds. That's what my dad did. It's a great answer. I'm either a shepherd or a race car driver. You look like a race car driver. I thought you're going to say look like a shepherd.
Starting point is 01:54:25
Well, you have that a sheep thing in the You look like a race car driver. You know, I thought you were going to say, look like a shepherd. No. Well, you have that a sheep thing in the corner over there. Yeah, yeah. The sheep hurting stick. Race car driver is a great, it's just a great way to not have to talk about Formula One. Yeah, I wish. But let's say you're at the cocktail party,
Starting point is 01:54:39
someone corners you, in a moment of weakness, you explain exactly what you do, or they've listened to this podcast, and they see your picture, and then they come up to you, and they go, hey, you're Richard Isaacson. And they say, look, I'm 30 years old, right? I'm as healthy as a horse.
Starting point is 01:54:53
There is nothing wrong with me. I couldn't even begin to relate to cognitive impairment. But, you know, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease when she was 70 years old, and by 80 she was dead. And let's just assume that the patient doesn't know their ApoE status
Starting point is 01:55:06
or any of these other things. You're not gonna see this patient again. You know, you're at a cocktail party and Los Angeles and you're flying back the next day. What are five things that you would put in the no regret move list that you could say to that person even at a general level?
Starting point is 01:55:22
I hate to be general, like to general, but one is knowledge is power. Learn about brain health now, because brain health incremental changes that you make now at 30, 40, 50, whatever, the earlier, the better, but throughout the life span, learn about brain health. So I will refer them to this website again. It's free, alz.org.
Starting point is 01:55:41
There's been 1.1 million people that have been on the site. I'll never be able to treat 100,000 people in my clinic. So go to the site, learn everything, or think possible. I can't tell you everything at a cocktail party. Are there diagnostic tests that people can do to get a sense of their own cognitive abilities? There are.
Starting point is 01:55:58
We don't give results at this time. We have like one test that gives results, but it's for research purposes. So it's for tracking. It's for tracking. So a patient can say, I'll take the test on ALZU once a year. There's email reminders to tell you to take. And do they get results if they're
Starting point is 01:56:10
performing satiria rates or do you get a result? No, this is for research purposes only, so everything's decoded. So right now, we don't give results, but give us a little more time. And we unfortunately don't have the funding to analyze this 1 million strong cohort, because when you get a million points of data
Starting point is 01:56:27
It's very expensive to analyze and we don't have the right statistical team So step one is at least go and familiarize yourself with all of this information Yeah, and I'm not trying to be like go whatever. I'm not trying to like everyone wants that like what do I do now? Do I what pills should I take? How much should I exercise? What's the magic dose to me? It's like if you're to really get serious about brain health, it's just not that simple. Our intake at the clinic is an hour and a half, cognitive testing, hour and a half with me, filling out a 45 minute survey, taking courses online before you can even get an appointment with me. You have to do all this pre-stuff. All time and time is for engines is not simple. Take the time. You're going to be watching YouTube or
Starting point is 01:57:01
flipping through Facebook or doing whatever the heck you're doing to waste time on your cell phone late at night, take the course online, you're going to learn things, internalize them, make incremental changes. Number one is education. Nelson Mandela said education is the most powerful tool to change the world, whatever the quote was that I mangled, but education is number one. Number two is know your numbers. What do I do about that? They want me actionable tips.
Starting point is 01:57:24
Actionable. No, take a step back, know your numbers. What is What do I do about, they want me actionable tips, actionable that no, take a step back, know your numbers, what is your blood pressure, what is your pulse, what is your body fat, what is your weight, what is your cholesterol, what is your blood sugar, know everything about yourself. Your body is a temple that's the saying, know everything about you know, you and I, I'm gonna use the aura ring I believe,
Starting point is 01:57:40
I use the wop biosensor, nothing to disclose, whatever, I know everything about. I do have something to disclose Which I disclose publicly I have invested in aura and I advise them so please make sure everybody knows yeah, of course So I want to know everything about my physiology about my sleep how many hours when I go to sleep when I whatever How much my exercises what my strain is what my output is what my average heart rate is my my resting pulse? I want to know I'm a data junkie. Right, now the person's ready to spill their drink on you.
Starting point is 01:58:07
They're like, I got it. I'm going to memorize the site. I'm going to learn everything about me. But I want to know, is there anything that I should be doing more or less of with respect to exercise, food, sleep, meditation, yoga, supplements? Are there any no regret moves? So exercise is the number one thing any person can do the only thing a person can do right now If they have amolored in their brain to reduce it or slow the accumulation is exercise in a regular basis
Starting point is 01:58:32
Yeah, when we were writing up what our white paper that eventually became the basis for the paper we collaborated on I remember when Dan first presented to me just internally like all of his findings. I guess I should take a step back and explain why we did this because I think it provides an example of how we started working together. But I remember he said that. He was like, Peter, you're not going to like this answer, but like there's literally only one thing in the literature that suggests that you have any hope of mitigating Alzheimer's disease.
Starting point is 01:59:03
And I was like, oh, wait, let me see if I can guess. And I came up with like 10 guesses and they were all wrong. And he goes, no, it's exercise. And I was like, okay, I mean, I get that exercise is important. But are you telling me that in the literature exercise is the only thing that meets level one evidence for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease? And look, I mean, that's an important thing to know.
Starting point is 01:59:21
I would say risk reduction. Yeah, risk reduction. So again, we could wax philosophically on why. By the way, the reason we ended up doing this is we read a review article by Dale Bredison, who many listeners will probably recognize, I don't know Dale, I've never met him. I don't even think we've exchanged emails, but we read a paper that was a pretty exhaustive paper based on his recommendations for Alzheimer's prevention. And we just wanted to start from first principles,
Starting point is 01:59:48
and there were 200 or so references in the paper, and poor, I don't know, Dan or Bob, or one or two analysts got the task of, please go and get every one of those references and make sure the references line up with what's being said. And I don't think this is deliberate. I think this is just the nature of what happens with people or any papers.
Starting point is 02:00:06
But like we couldn't verify a third of these references. For example, there was one reference that said, take risk veritrol. And we went to that paper and that paper, while it was about risk veritrol, it had nothing to do with risk veritrol, and also it was a bit of a revenge. So that's when we decided we just wanted
Starting point is 02:00:20
to do this from first principles. We wanted to go and take a first principles approach and we had an unusual methodology as you recall which was start from an intervention look at an intermediary and understand a Mechanistic pathway and then how does it lead to the convergence of a final common pathway? And so in many ways, Dale's work was helpful to get us started But we felt that we wanted to do better could we do better if we were able to abandon everything that had been done? So do better. Could we do better if we were able to abandon everything that had been done? So exercise. Let's go back to the woman at the cocktail party. She wants to exercise.
Starting point is 02:00:49
Is there a type of exercise? Do we have any belief that you talked about high intensity training? Do we believe that that's better than sitting on the elliptical for 30 minutes, or going for a run or lifting weights? Here I go again, not one size fits all, but know your numbers. What is your body fat? What is your muscle mass, men body fat, is less important potentially. Muscle mass is probably more protective of unbrain health women body fat.
Starting point is 02:01:09
Why do we think that is? I smart people smarter than me have told me this. Mechanistically, is it glucose disposal, is it other circulating factors? IGF seems to be somewhat protective? That's not over my pay-grader, whatever that's saying is. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure, but I can tell you that mixing it up is important.
Starting point is 02:01:27
The vast majority of evidence out there is aerobic exercise, minimum of 150 to 180 minutes a week, for example, and that's mixing it up. Most people would say based on the preponderance of evidence, two thirds cardio, one third strength training, but someone's gonna have to personalize it based on themselves, you know, for me, I'd spend this morning, I do spin class. I was never a spin person, and this is not.
Starting point is 02:01:49
I don't want to get. I go to Flywheel. I live Flywheel in Peloton. Why do I like those two? Because I know my numbers. I can see my, it's actually competitive, because I can race against people in the class. But it tells me what my torque is, what my average output is. And that way I can know.
Starting point is 02:02:03
I can see, well, what is my pulse, what is my strain, what is my... So just to be clear, when you talk about, I think anybody can dog it, but if you're doing a palatine class right, you're working up a sweat. I mean, it's a very different experience than, I'm gonna go on the elliptical and watch the news
Starting point is 02:02:18
while I'm raising my pulse from 80 to 90. That doesn't seem to count as exercise. Oh, no, and it's like, and I talked about the patients all the time. They say, oh, I go to an elliptical three times a week. I do 45 minutes. I'm like, really? Well, yeah, I don't mind it. I talk to my friends, I text on the board, I do that watch TV. In my spin class, I can't talk. I can grunt.
Starting point is 02:02:39
That's about it. I can grunt, and then I am a absolute mess. And the amount of, you amount of my average pulse rate during a class is over 150, I don't know, 155-ish, sometimes higher, sometimes lower, and my max is going to be, say, 180. Give or take. I know these numbers. So high-intensity interval training is important, but you've got to be careful because if you do too much, you're going to burn muscle. So I have to be able to hurt yourself.
Starting point is 02:03:02
Yeah. Exactly. And I started off very low weight and I was getting back into exercise several years ago. And I, you know, now I'm at higher weights, but I do weights. At least once a week, I hate weight training, but I should probably do it twice a week. I probably, I only do it on average once, maybe once and a half. You definitely need to be doing it two or three times a week. It's a big, it's a big problem. I completely understand you and my primary care doctor,
Starting point is 02:03:22
who is like a clone of you in a sudden in a different way. way. If you want no other proof point, just look at all of her sacks. Do you know like what a beast that guy was? I was like a powerlifting champion in medical school and residency. When he passed away, there were some really, really remarkable tributes to this man who not only is I didn't have the luxury of knowing him, did you? He's lectured at a seminar and I talked to him for about 10 seconds. Oh wow. Yeah, I't have the luxury of knowing him, did you? He's lectured at a seminar, I talked to him for about 10 seconds. Oh wow. I mean, I never had the luxury of knowing this remarkable human being,

but I was amazed after his passing to learn so much about him that I didn't know. Because, you know, you always saw him and he looked like a fit strong guy in photos as an older guy, but then to see pictures of this guy in his 20s and 30s, I was like, my god. Neurologist. Powerlifter. You're the neurologist DJ, he can be the neurologist. Powerlifter. Indeed.
Starting point is 02:04:09
So muscle strength. So she's loosening her grip on the glass now, you've actually given her that. That leads to my next question. Should she be drinking alcohol or more to the point, should she think about moderating her alcohol? Sure. So alcohol wouldn't go in my top five because there's a lot of other stuff. Meaning moderation of alcohol would not be on the bottom. Not in like my five like most important things.
Starting point is 02:04:29
You know, Niefsien Collins in 2011 or so came out with a paper that basically said, one to two drinks a day in men and one drink a day in women is probably protective. Then you have all these new UK studies that show actually if you do zero, that's better. So the data is a little bit all over the place. I kind of hedge my bets and I say women for drinks a week, men 7 to 10, and other people that are really smart that I work with says, is the distinction you make in women to be lower because the risk is higher or do you think it's related more to body mass or muscle mass? The latter body mass muscle mass and the, and the data with the data shows.
Starting point is 02:05:05
I'm not sure exactly why. I know those data kind of suspect. I think there's so much healthy user bias in those data that I, but again, I think one also has to balance, you know, I sort of think of alcohol like I think of Tylenol. There is no dose of Tylenol that isn't taxing your liver, right? So if you are asking the question, as a hepatocyte, the smallest cell within a liver, how much Tylenol is too much? It's like any amount becomes too much, any amount becomes taxing. So the question is, if you take a hepatocentric view of Tylenol, you should never, ever, ever consume it.
Starting point is 02:05:40
But the reality of it is we're not just walking livers, we're walking people, and sometimes we have fevers, and sometimes we have pain, and things for which Tylenol is a remarkable drug. So we have to balance that. And so similarly, I would say alcohol is a known hepatotoxin. There is no dose of ethanol that isn't on some level chronically toxic to the liver. The question is, we're not walking livers. Therefore, are there benefits of alcohol that may, in the early stages of administration, offset some of the downside? And I think the answer for some people probably is, yes. I mean, I have patients who, if they don't sit there and sip their cognac at night, it's
Starting point is 02:06:16
very difficult for them to unwind. And while I can sit there and lecture them about how they need to pick a different unwinding practice, in the end, if you can monitor a bunch of things, you know, I sort of take the view that says, look, there's no measurable harm that's being done by this. Your liver function tests are incredibly low. Your coagulation factors are low. It's not producing other adverse harm. Maybe there's benefit.
Starting point is 02:06:38
But it'll be interesting to see how that story shakes out in Alzheimer's disease because you could certainly come up with plausible hypothesis on either side of that. Yeah, I have much stronger evidence than other things. So since the evidence is murky, I always hedge my bets like you say sometimes and less is more, but I'm not sure a little bit. So where are the things where you feel stronger? So nutrition has to come after exercise, but again, education, know your numbers, because nutrition is a close second, probably,
Starting point is 02:07:06
I mean, honestly, vascular risk factor modification is probably after exercise. So I should probably put nutrition next. But vascular risk factor modification, cholesterol, diabetes, blood pressure control, the sprint mind study, just if you haven't heard about the study, it's like a major, major, major, important study in the field that needs to be on like every.
Starting point is 02:07:24
Yeah, it's really modified the way I think about blood pressure management. Yeah, I mean, and this was a five-year study, it's like a major, major, major important study in the field that needs to be on like every. Yeah, it's really modified the way I think about blood pressure management. Yeah, and this was a five year study, it was the sprint study, which is trying to figure out, do people, you know, because the lowering blood pressure less than 140 has always been a little bit unclear, like does it improve outcomes. So the study in cardiovascular disease was, and I may be paraphrasing, but is 140s better or is 120 better? It's a stomach. And, you know, there's always been this like dogma where, oh, you've got to be careful. You can't lower blood pressure too much and someone is older because they're going to over 70, other going to pass out and they're going to have bad outcomes and fall. So in the Sprint
Starting point is 02:07:53
Mind Study, they ended the study early because the outcomes were so much better in the 120s that actually there were no side effects either. So they stopped the study early. Well, the Sprint Mind study then looked at outcomes several years later. It's been mine study. This is just like a several years in follow-up, like not like 10 or 20, just even after a few years and this intervention was not that long,
Starting point is 02:08:16
actually showed a reduction in the people that had blood pressure more tightly controlled to a systolic of 120. Actually had a reduction in development of MCI, mild cognitive impairment by 19%. That is huge. Over how many years, two years? I think it was after three and a half fish,
Starting point is 02:08:37
four years of treatment of lower, and then they stopped the study at five years or whatever, and then three years later, or something like that, I'm mangling it. But long story short, I mean, 19% risk reduction of MCI, and then you add in the exercise and the blueberries and the low carbs and the this and the precision medicine. I mean, we're talking tangible, like, real stuff. All right, so let's go to nutrition.
Starting point is 02:08:57
Why blueberries? Ianthrocyanins, some mangling had to pronounce that too. Robert Cricorian, pioneer, I believe, in the field of nutrition research and Alzheimer's disease. So the antioxidants you think provide benefit? You would be the person to ask about this, but I know he has a paper that he's been trying to figure out. Is it the blueberry? Is it the anthorsan? And then is it the whole fruit? Can you just take out the compound?
Starting point is 02:09:17
I don't know that I'm 100% sure. I think it may just be the compound. I'm an... I actually got an email about this in my news. You know, we get those newsletters every day about Alzheimer's disease. And I think they mentioned this in today's newsletter, which was, yeah, just the idea was, could this be one of the more potent antioxidants that could be studied in clinical trials?
Starting point is 02:09:37
Because, you know, a doctor's recording is looking at, you know, not just blueberry intake, but these wild blueberries, these are non-biwild. And we say, okay, well, what about blueberry powder? Can we just take the blueberry powder? Well, then can what about blueberry powder? Can we just take the blueberry powder? Well, then can we go even deeper? Can we just take the active ingredient? So nutrition research, people say, well, first of all, nutrition research is hard to study.
Starting point is 02:09:54
But there's a science to nutrition research and just randomizing 100 people to one diet versus another. People aren't mice, you can't just like make sure that they eat that diet. People go to McDonald's and do other things that they shouldn't do. So nutrition research is very difficult. Where are McDonald's bad? McDonald's.
Starting point is 02:10:11
I'm just taking notes here for the girl at the company. Right. Now McDonald's is not, my cousin Stacy caught me at McDonald's once and got pictures. It was a problem. But, you know, everything in moderation, everything in moderation. I have had two McFlurry's, Oriole McFlurry's in the last year. Like, once in moderation, everything in moderation. I have had two Macflurry's, Oreo Macflurry's in the last year. Like once in a while from now. I'm not judging by the way, I'm just craving one myself right now.
Starting point is 02:10:30
Oh, Oreo Macflurry's man, like forget it. Anyway, long story, you don't even have sugar in your house. I had put xylitol in my coffee, killing me, man. So nutrition would be, you know, lower carbs, good carbs versus bad carbs, green leafy vegetables, so, so, so important. Any role of fasting, any early data on intermittent fasting or caloric restriction?
Starting point is 02:10:49
Well, I don't have data in my practice just yet, but we recommend our diploma diet is looking at 12 hours versus 16 hours in the differential effects. Unfortunately, I have looked at that data, not written up, not published. There's a lot of noise. I think 16 is better, five times a week, better than 12. I don't know the 12 works. The error bars and our data is are so wide. Yeah, I think your sample size is too small and there's too much variability at this point.
Starting point is 02:11:13
You sent me some of those data in the weeks again. Yeah, I think I did. Yeah, that's why we need to take all these different clinics and all these different programs and get a uniform data set. So that's a pretty good list. I think you've given her five things. Yeah, and know, stress reduction is important. And you know, whether it's meditation or blah, blah, blah, do whatever you need to do to be stressed, deep breaths, sleep is super important. I'm getting adequate sleep.
Starting point is 02:11:33
You don't lose fat and you don't get healthy if you're not sleeping well. And it's the same thing. You age terribly when you're not sleeping well. So there's a lot of component sleep stress. So I guess they're reciprocal to this question. We're now no longer the cocktail party, but we're sitting back here at the table. Everything that you described to this woman is quote unquote lifestyle based.
Starting point is 02:11:55
Meaning the top five things that you suggested that she would do once she understood her baseline, all have to do with modifying how she eats, drinks, exercises, sleeps, and manages stress. What that makes me wonder is, when we see the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease today higher than it was 40 years ago? Well, I'm terrible with this. I shouldn't admit this on a recorded podcast, but the rate of Alzheimer's cases actually coming down.
Starting point is 02:12:24
The incidence is coming down. The incidence is coming down. The incidence is coming down. But prevalence is going up because of our aging population. Okay, but the incidence today is still much higher than it was 40 years ago, even though it's less than what it was 10 years ago. And as you said, of course, the prevalence, which is I think of the prevalence as the integral, right? It's the area under the curve of what you're accumulating is so much higher.
Starting point is 02:12:40
Both of these facts taken together suggest there is something triggering environmentally Alzheimer's disease more today than 40 years ago, which is usually a constellation of these lifestyle factors. So do you believe that the difference in prevalence today from the year we were born is what percent a result of the changes in these environmental factors you just mentioned versus what percent in increase in awareness and diagnostic acumen. I've written on this and my answer is I don't know. But it's some combination of both.
Starting point is 02:13:09
It's both, it's both. Yeah, I mean, you know, Alzheimer's is a huge stigma in shame, right? Now people are coming out of the shadows and talking about it more. And there's like young people that are talking about, you know, Seth Rogen has his charity, hilarity for charity, and they're raising money
Starting point is 02:13:24
for Alzheimer's education and young people. I mean, they're talking about, you know, Seth Rogen has his charity, hilarity for charity, and they're raising money for Alzheimer's education and young people. I mean, they're talking about Alzheimer's in high school students and college students and medical students. I mean, like, the conversation is not only like getting better, but you have like people that are speaking up on its behalf and kind of adding a new flavor to it. So, there's much less stigma, much more attention to it.
Starting point is 02:13:42
Doctors are talking about it, not just senility, oh, that's normal with age. We now have biomarkers. So sure, sure, we have all that. But we, this is definitely lifestyle component to, you know, sitting all day, there's like, sitting as a new smoking, I think, you know, that I've heard whatever about that.
Starting point is 02:13:58
That's like really bad for the brain. It's not just bad for the bigger the belly, as the belly gets larger, the memory center in the brain, the hippocampus gets smaller. So you know metabolic conditions and lack of activity and sedentary lifestyles, like it doesn't just affect the belly and the body, it affects the brain because they're all connected. So that reminds me of another question that I have, which is how much does mental activity ward this off?
Starting point is 02:14:25
You know, we hear so often the anecdote of Bernie was working his little tail away, beavering away, and then when he retired to play golf, it all went to hell in a hand basket. And then the other one you often hear anecdotally is, once so-and-so spouse passed away, oh my God, the remaining spouse just regressed completely and seemed to have this accelerated case of all sorts of events. So the idea here being once that person retired and
Starting point is 02:14:51
they weren't cognitively engaged and they weren't not to say golf is cognitively bankrupt, but presumably it's less cognitively engaging than whatever that person was doing before. Or once the sense of purpose, the social support vanishes, again, anecdotally, this seems overwhelmingly the case. Is there any data to support that? So yes, but it's complicated. The cognitive reserve. Can't one thing just be free-consumption? No, Alzheimer's prevention.
Starting point is 02:15:18
No, man, this is the system. You sound like me, man. Everything's complicated. Everything's complicated. I wish I could give you a concise bullet point state, you know, like a bumper sticker. Yeah, the live TV you got to give them like a quick snapshot, not on this topic. So early life risk factors for Alzheimer's are different than midlife and late life and early life risk can be mitigated most so by long term educational attainment. That's the best evidence we have.
Starting point is 02:15:45
We also have to be clear. Has that been normalized for socioeconomic status? It strikes me as almost impossible to normalize that for socioeconomic status. Above my pay grade, don't know the literature as well as I mean. The point here being like, people who go on to get secondary,
Starting point is 02:16:00
interstary, education are gonna have lower risk. Is it because of the things that enable them to do that, perhaps having more resources, lead to them doing other healthy lifestyle things that go beyond the education as- I hope the studies have controlled for that, but I know it's impossible to control for everything. But that being said, I think early life educational attainment. For example, musical experience, midlife,
Starting point is 02:16:23
and midlife musical experience as well as early life absolutely can give build up greater cognitive reserves that when you get Alzheimer's you're more resilient, you have this resiliency. The other aspect is- And I don't know enough about music but when you were the cello playing, two bass guitar playing guy, what part of the brain is getting exercise when you do that? It's very multimodal. The parietal lobe is the music side, maybe on the right side. The reading music notes is kind of like language. So it'll be the left side of the brain and that's visual.
Starting point is 02:16:52
It's basically an association. Cortes is basically the whole brain is talking to each other. So I think music is a great way to recruit different parts of the brain to work together and the stronger those pathways get, the better the person does. And again, teleologically, that makes so much sense. I guess it begs the question. I would argue we will never know the answer to this question, because if we're going to have to rely on very loose epidemiology, which can never be fully controlled and suffers from all of the
Starting point is 02:17:18
usual problems that epidemiology suffers from, the question ought to be, is there any harm in believing that the epidemiology is right, attaining a higher level of education, staying more mentally engaged, sustaining more loving social supporting relationships, having a greater sense of purpose, learning to play a musical instrument? I mean, is there a chance that doing those things increases your risk? Well, I don't think that there's been any evidence to suggest that it increases risk, but then there's this whole, you know, the naysayers will say, well, what is the cost? What are the trade-offs? What's the opportunity cost? What's also the, how much does it, like, music lessons? You're going to pay money
Starting point is 02:17:51
to do music lessons or buy a guitar, but shouldn't you be, like, buying healthy food? So there's a lot of confusion. And there's, when we get reviewers of our papers, this comes up all the time. So I'm not sure. All I can say is when you build a better backup pathway in the brain, and you, there's a saying, if you don't use it, you lose it. Well, someone that has Alzheimer's and is very cognitively engaged and has a good backup pathway, they're not going to decline as quickly. That being said, once the disease takes hold, and maybe they stop working or they stop the loser sense of purpose, you can have a much more sharper decline.
Starting point is 02:18:23
So people with high cognitive reserve, high cognitive backup systems are resistant to the effects of the amyloid. But there's a time that comes when they decline and those people decline much more sharply than others, because they had like this emergency backup system. But sometimes when the parachute fails, the person goes down and in all time resistance.
Starting point is 02:18:42
Wow, that's a subtle, that's a nuance. I wouldn't have predicted. It makes sense. The mechanism that you postulate makes sense. And you know, you gave the other example of the woman whose husband passed away and then she just went downhill because when you have a collaborative relationship and you know when one person's brain isn't working well but you have another person to cover for you and do the dishes and feed you and then that person has gone aside from depression, serotonin,
Starting point is 02:19:06
and you have all that. Oh, I see this all the time. Like I knew she had it, but then the husband, and caregivers of Alzheimer's patients have terribly higher medical illnesses. And when the husband dies, and he was the primary caregiver and the wife, has Alzheimer's, that person will decline absolutely exponentially. I saw this in a high school teacher of mine. I see this all the time.
Starting point is 02:19:29
You know, Richard, your passion for this is palpable. And I mean, I feel like we could talk a lot more about other things, including I think some of the stories of your patients or some of the most remarkable stories. No. Both the successes and the failures truthfully. The failures are what keep you doing what you're doing doing and you are probably the hardest work in neurologist. What's the expression of the hardest work in the show business?
Starting point is 02:19:52
The hardest work in neurologist and show business. I know you personally, so I can say this from a close perspective, your drive to help patients is a beautiful thing. And I know that the patients that you get to work with directly are blessed. And more importantly, I think your work will have a tremendous impact on people that you will not have the luxury or privilege of laying hands on because there's only one Richard. But there are lots of neurologists like you who I think want to be able to do more.
Starting point is 02:20:19
And I think it's really special that you have built the team around you that you have that I didn't actually know the story about the Dean of the medical center Cornell taking this big chance on you. I mean I knew it was obscure to have an Alzheimer's prevention clinic. Of course you now have the largest Alzheimer's prevention clinic in the United States. It's a really heartwarming story to know that a big name medical center would take a risk on a young up and coming neurologist and sort of give him the keys to that kingdom.
Starting point is 02:20:46
And I hope that if one person listening to this is sort of thinking, you know what, that's the way I want to deploy my philanthropic dollars in Alzheimer's disease. Maybe I'll hedge on the side of prevention. Hopefully this discussion will have been worth it for you. And I appreciate that. I never asked for a single dollar until the bottom dropped out about a year ago and you Peter helped. And I've never asked for money, I've never asked for a single dollar. It's the worst feeling in the world Oh man
Starting point is 02:21:10
I guess, I can't ask for a single dollar But it's like so little can go so far, you know I sent you on the way over here an abstract like the hot off the press literally we finished it at 4.32 p.m And I forwarded to you and I got here at 5. And I forwarded this to you. And like, you read the final statement and you know this hasn't been published yet. So I can't exactly, you know, read it out loud or whatever. And you read that statement and you're like, whoa, if this is the abstract
Starting point is 02:21:32
and if I'm about to read this paper and this paper holds water, this statement, wow. We're so close and you know, we're every day we're moving closer. But that being said, we have thousands of pages of already collected data that we can't really jump into. So I appreciate your call to action and I can tell you that our philanthropic funds
Starting point is 02:21:53
that have come in, we use immediately in two carol. Yeah, the carol. A lot of those dollars is remarkable. You know, there are a lot of people who say, look, I mean, maybe I can only part with $25,000, $50,000, which in New York, philanthropic surplus is nothing. You don't get your name on a bench for that much.
Starting point is 02:22:08
What a difference it can make in your clinic. Oh, several thousand dollars is helpful, but you have 50, 25 hundred. Yeah, I could just do so much tomorrow, but I'm not asking for money because that's just done. I was raised. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, screw it. I'm asking for money for it.
Starting point is 02:22:22
Well, with that said, Indian or Persian or Turkish tonight for dinner. Ooh, there's a neurology resident happy hour that I may need to stop by for a second, so maybe somewhere near there. Okay. Okay. I figured out. That's like a few blocks away, but yeah, I prefer food with no taste. So, and I don't do onions, garlic, shallots, scallions.
Starting point is 02:22:43
Oh, for heavens. I don't do onions. I'm gonna go out dinner by myself. You can go to your restaurant. I don't do onions, garlic, shallots, scallions. Oh, for heavens. I don't do allions. I'm gonna go after the nearby myself. Yeah, I'll run through cilantro. But no, no, no, but I like plain janglet. We'll find something to talk about. We've got some tablets. Very helpful.
