Paula is a professor of OBGYN at Oregon Health and Science University and a leading expert in reproductive endocrinology and infertility. She's been on the forefront of research and clinical practice of IVF, fertility preservation, and reproductive aging. Today we then continue our two-part series on infertility.
Starting point is 00:01:28
Last week, of course, we covered the male side of this with Dr. Paul Turek, and this week we're talking more about female infertility with Paula. In this episode, we discuss the biology of female fertility, how hormonal shifts drive the menstrual cycle and regulate ovulation, and what those patterns reveal about fertility potential. How infertility is defined, where to begin a workup, and why both partners should be evaluated early. The role of the fallopian tube in natural conception and how infections and or structural issues can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy. The reality of miscarriage and why most early losses
Starting point is 00:02:05
are due to chromosomal abnormalities, not anything the patient is doing wrong, increasing impact of age, lifestyle, and environmental factors on fertility, especially as more people delay childbearing, causes and treatment options for polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS, the emergence of GLP-1 agonists in PCOS and what we know and don't
Starting point is 00:02:27
know yet about their impact on fertility and pregnancy safety, the nuances of diagnosing and treating unexplained infertility and how age and ovarian reserve shape clinical decisions, the evolution of IVF from early methods of today's technologies, including the use of pre-implantation genetic testing, considerations around egg freezing, how timing, age, and egg quantity influence outcomes and decision-making, promise and limitations of next-gen reproductive technologies such as mitochondrial replacement, and many other things.
Starting point is 00:03:01
So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Dr. Paula Amato. Hey Paula, thank you so much for coming to Austin and sitting down to share some remarkable insights. Listeners last week will have heard us talk about all things that pertain to male fertility. And as promised, we're going to now talk about fertility, but from the female perspective, the physiology here is different, but no less complex. And there are some pretty unique things about it. One of them being that unlike sperm, which seemed to be an infinite resource, men are constantly generating literally billions of these things. The exact
Starting point is 00:03:41
opposite is the case with women. Tell us a bit about that. That's right. First, thanks for having me. Thanks for inviting me. It is true that when an embryo or fetus develops, the gonad differentiates into either a testes or an ovary. And the main difference, as you said, is that sperm is produced throughout a man's lifetime, whereas women are born with a finite number of eggs.
Starting point is 00:04:04
Actually, the most eggs you'll ever have is when you're in your mom's womb as a fetus. And by the time you're born, there's about 2 million or so eggs. And by the time you start menstruating, you're down to maybe 400,000 or so. Yeah. Wow. So a five-fold reduction from birth to, say, average age would be maybe 14? Yeah, 12 to 14. And we don't know why exactly that happens, but most of the eggs in the ovaries actually
Starting point is 00:04:30
undergo a process we call atresia. They basically die. So once a woman goes through puberty or a girl goes through puberty, every month, if she's not on hormonal contraception, one of those eggs grows. Actually, probably a group of eggs every month starts to grow, but then one takes over and is released from the ovary and usually finds its way into the fallopian tubes,
Starting point is 00:04:55
that's the tube connecting the ovary and the uterus. And then normally, if there's not sperm around, the egg just resorbs and there's no pregnancy and the lining of the uterus sheds and the girl or woman has a period every month. If there's sperm around, there's a chance that that egg might fertilize and that fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube actually. And then that now zygote or embryo travels down the tube into the uterus and some of the time implants into the wall
Starting point is 00:05:27
of the uterus or lining of the uterus and establishes a pregnancy. Okay. So let's now talk about a woman in the prime of her reproductive age. She's 20 years old as an example. And let's talk through the cycle of what is happening and the role that hormones are playing. One of the things that to me has always been fascinating about this is the selection. So with males, we don't have to think about that problem. The selection tends to be maybe more metabolic or stochastic.
Starting point is 00:05:57
In other words, which sperm is the sperm that makes it isn't really predetermined. How is it that, let's say from day zero zero when a woman begins her menstrual cycle and all of a sudden everything starts to turn towards the next cycle, she's about 14 days out from ovulation, we start to see the interplay of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone particularly FSH, walk me through what's happening in that period of time that ultimately leads to one and only one egg being the chosen one. Yeah, it's a little random in women as well, actually. But it's true that the pituitary hormones, namely FSH or follicle stimulating hormone
Starting point is 00:06:39
and LH, luteinizing hormone, are what drives growth of the, we call them follicles. The eggs are inside the follicles. And as I said, usually a cohort of eggs starts to grow. 06. Tell me what grow means. 07. The follicles start to get bigger and the cells surrounding the eggs start to divide. 08.
Starting point is 00:07:00
And what do they look like prior to all of that happening? These are cells that only have 50% of the genetic material. They've already undergone meiosis. Yes. Meiosis, they're kind of arrested in meiosis and meiosis not completed until they actually ovulate, and then in some cases are fertilized. So we have an arrested cell that has one of each of the mother's chromosomes, including one X chromosome by definition, one of her two sex hormones. And I don't know if this question makes sense, but is it still in its young phenotype?
Starting point is 00:07:40
In other words, if the woman is 20 years old and all of the cells in her body are functionally 20 years old, is this egg prior to ovulation still basically an infant cell? Dr. Ketchum As far as we know, although there's some data recently to suggest that perhaps the cells surrounding the egg are metabolically active and maybe aging. Certainly we do know that the quality of the eggs decreases right as women get older. So that affects how the eggs and the chromosomes ultimately divide. That's part of the reason it's harder to get pregnant as you get older. Even though you're ovulating, you may be releasing an egg every month,
Starting point is 00:08:25
but that egg could be abnormal. And if it's abnormal, it likely won't fertilize. And you kind of don't want it to fertilize if it's abnormal and establish your pregnancy. But you're right, they're pretty much arrested in time, certainly before puberty. And then every month, a few start to develop. And then one, we don't really know
Starting point is 00:08:44
how that one egg is selected. Definitely hormonal factors play a role, but it's somewhat random. One kind of grows and then eventually is released. 06 Now, not to anthropomorphize this too much, but one would sort of assume that natural selection runs strong. And if a woman, by the time she begins her fertility stage of life, has 400,000 eggs, just say on average, she only has a finite number of shots on goal.
Starting point is 00:09:18
Let's just say 12 per year and I don't know, let's just say if you look at peak reproductive, maybe 20 years, that's a tiny sliver of 400,000. That's true. You would have to assume that there is some selection that's happening to pick the best few hundred of those 400,000. Is there any evidence that that's happening? Only in that the ones that usually result in pregnancy are chromosomally normal. So most of the embryos are chromosomally abnormal and that's because most of the eggs
Starting point is 00:09:52
are chromosomally abnormal. So there is selection in that sense. Most of the time only the chromosomally normal embryos are the ones that implant and continue to develop. And when you say chromosomally normal, are you referring to the egg or the zygote? The zygote, but most of the abnormalities in chromosomes that happen in a zygote
Starting point is 00:10:13
are believed to be related to maternal age. And does that mean we think that the abnormality occurred way before ovulation? Or when do we think that that occurred? We think it occurred in the stage of meiosis that happens as the egg is developing that month. That ripening phase. Yes. So explain how that happens. If you were to sample eggs from a five-year-old girl,
Starting point is 00:10:40
nowhere near reproductive age, so every one of those is in a state of frozen meiosis. How many things have to happen before it is ready to undergo full meiosis? In other words, how does it go from that stage to, I'm sorry for using big words to the listener, and please feel free to explain what I mean by aneuploidy, but how do you go from that frozen meiotic state to an aneuploidic state? And please explain what I just said to people. Sure. It's a little bit of a black box, of course, because we can't see exactly what's happening.
Starting point is 00:11:11
But the way we understand it is that the cells start off including egg cells as having two copies of each chromosome, but eventually has to become one copy in order to combine with a sperm that also has one copy of each chromosome. So during that process, there has to be disjunction of each of the pairs of chromosomes. So there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, including X and Y, the sex chromosomes. And during that disjunction phase is when we think most of the errors happen. Because if they don't divide evenly, like 23 and 23, you're gonna get an extra one, you're gonna be missing one, and then when it combines with sperm that also has a haploid
Starting point is 00:11:56
set of chromosomes, there's gonna be an abnormal number, and that affects development. Soterios Johnson And that completion only occurs during the 14 days leading to ovulation? 06. Soterios Johnson Ovulation and then fertilization, yes. 06. Soterios Johnson Okay. So that explains why, to my earlier question, there must be something, even though they
Starting point is 00:12:16
are quote unquote frozen in time, there is either something going on with the egg or maybe the metabolic milieu around the egg from those cells that is changing the probability of success for that division of genetic material. As we know that as a woman ages, the probability of successful division goes down. Right. So something changes as a woman ages, but we don't understand exactly. But whatever it is that's going on makes those chromosome errors much more likely. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:12:51
I'll tell you a very interesting story. A very close friend of mine has a son with Down syndrome and he's probably 20 now. So this is the story I'm telling occurred roughly 20 years ago. So when their son was born, I believe he was their third child. This is probably at a time, I don't think they knew until this was, in fact, I know that they didn't know until birth. They hadn't done amniocentesis or anything like that. They're sort of dealing with this, right, in the aftermath of their son's birth. And the doctor, the GYN came in and my friend says, he never forget this, the guy looked straight at his wife and said, look, it's
Starting point is 00:13:25
important for you to understand that this is your fault. And my friend said he wanted to jump across the table and kill this guy. Yeah, I don't blame him. But then what he realized is what he was actually saying is this is the result of the egg releasing one too many. He had two copies of of was it 21? Yeah So two copies of 21 instead of one copy of 21 came from the egg It's interesting my friend when I have talked about this many times since and he said I really came to
Starting point is 00:13:56
Appreciate what he was trying to do there albeit in then completely inappropriate way He was just trying to explain that there is a reason for this. It is maternal and whatever. But anyway, it always stuck with me is that's a great lesson in bad bedside manner. For sure. Yeah. But he made the point. The point here being is while trisomy 21 is a very common form of aneuploidy, it's also
Starting point is 00:14:21
not lethal. There are many lethal forms of aneuploidy as well. Right. Right. Trisomy 21 can, it's also not lethal. There are many lethal forms of aneuploidy as well. Right, right. Trisomy 21 can be lethal, but not always. So some of those pregnancies do continue. Depending on the chromosomal abnormalities, some only develop to a certain point and then stop developing. And some are actually compatible with live birth, but usually have some abnormalities.
Starting point is 00:14:42
And do we know, for example, that if you were to look at all miscarriages that occur inside the first trimester, would you be able to hazard a guess as to what percentage of all miscarriages inside of 13 weeks are likely the result of aneuploidy? Definitely the majority of them, probably close to 90% of them, yeah. Okay, so in other words,
Starting point is 00:15:03
maybe someone listening to this who's experienced miscarriages early in a pregnancy can take some solace in understanding that that was the body's way of correcting something that was inevitable sooner rather than later? Yeah. I think that's true. Yeah. Miscarriages are very common, and that's the most common cause. Although there are other causes, usually we don't do a whole lot of testing if it's just
Starting point is 00:15:28
one miscarriage because that's very common. We just assume fetus or embryo was abnormal. But if a woman has two in a row, then that warrants some additional testing. – Regardless of her age? – Regardless of her age. Obviously, the chances of finding something else goes down as a woman gets older, because you don't want to miss another cause that's potentially treatable. Okay.
Starting point is 00:15:50
Well, let's put a pin in that because I actually want to understand that more. But that's interesting to me that if a 40-year-old woman had successive miscarriages, you wouldn't just chalk it up to, well, she's 40, of course, these are aneuploidic eggs. Yeah, that's true. I mean, that's most likely. Most likely, but across- But again, you don't want to miss, especially at 40, you don these are aneuploidic eggs. Yeah, that's true. I mean, that's most likely. Most likely, but across- But again, you don't wanna miss, especially at 40, you don't wanna miss some treatable,
Starting point is 00:16:09
other treatable costs. Right, because you only have so much time. Limited time. One of the lessons here, hopefully for people listening, is if a couple miscarriages, they shouldn't feel that they've done something wrong. Definitely not. The woman shouldn't beat herself up thinking, oh my God, did I have one too many cups of coffee,
Starting point is 00:16:24
or was I under too much stress? No, greater than 90% chance this was a bad split and that's the way it works. So let's go back to this process. So it's day zero, so a woman just begins her period. We're just getting ready to embark on her next fertility cycle. The pituitary gland is secreting luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone.
Starting point is 00:16:47
Walk me through what is happening in the next 14 days that leads to that ovulation. So, a group of eggs or follicles are starting to grow. One gets selected. We don't really understand. We still don't know how. We don't understand why. It's random. And that follicle that's in a follicle, follicle is kind of a fluid-filled cyst-like
Starting point is 00:17:06
structure that surrounds each egg. So that continues to grow. And then eventually what's happening hormonally, so those cells surrounding the eggs are producing estrogen. That estrogen is preparing, acting on the uterine lining to build up the lining to potentially support a pregnancy. And then what happens just before ovulation is there's a surge in a hormone called LH,
Starting point is 00:17:31
luteinizing hormone, and that's what we think triggers ovulation or release of an egg. So all that has to happen before an egg is released, so it busts out of the ovary, finds its way to the tube. How energetically demanding is that? We learned last week in talking with Paul that the ATP requirement for those sperm to travel all that distance is unbelievable. How passive versus active is the movement of that egg? How metabolically demanding is it? I don't know that we understand it completely,
Starting point is 00:18:07
but you would imagine that their energy is required for that to happen, certainly. So it's not passive. It's not just sort of a diffusion down the fallopian tube. Right. Prostaglandins are involved, and calcium, all kinds of things have to happen for that process to occur.
Starting point is 00:18:24
OK. How long approximately, just give people a sense of how long a fallopian tube is? Probably a few centimeters, five to 10. Okay, everyone's probably used to seeing the image of ovaries being these little eggs and fallopian tubes having these little fingers that hug up on the eggs. What is actually in between that space? How does the egg get from an ovary into a fallopian tube?
Starting point is 00:18:45
Is there an actual connection there? There is actually. They're not stuck together, but they're kind of in close proximity so that those fimbriae or finger-like projections kind of sweep up the egg once it's released from the ovary. Got it. And it's otherwise in direct contact with the peritoneum.
Starting point is 00:19:02
The ovary and the tubes, yeah, pretty much. The space between them. Yeah. The space between them.um. The ovary and the tubes, yeah, pretty much. The space between them. Yeah, the pictures always show the tubes out here and the eggs out here, but they're actually everything's closer together in the pelvis. Okay, so egg is now in the fallopian tube. How long does it take to get through the length of the fallopian tube into the uterus? About five or six days. Okay, so completely different experience from the sperm,
Starting point is 00:19:26
which are racing at breakneck speed and cover that distance in seconds. So what regulates the speed with which the egg travels through the fallopian tube and how does that impact fertility? Is there a scenario whereby it happens too quickly and things don't work? I don't know about too quickly,
Starting point is 00:19:43
but there are hair-like projections in the tubes, cilia, that help with motility of the egg down the fallopian tube into the uterus. The abnormalities on the female side, denture abnormalities, have to do with scarring in the tubes or if the tubes are blocked, and then it interferes with the egg encountering the sperm. What leads to that?
Starting point is 00:20:07
A number of different things. Infection probably most commonly, but also scarring from previous surgery potentially or a condition called endometriosis. So there are a number of things that can affect the tubes as well. Is the day four, assuming a woman's cycle is predictable and normal and we just say day 14 is ovulation, that is the day that the egg leaves the ovary or that is the day that the egg reaches a certain place within the fallopian tube? Pretty much the day that the egg is released from the ovary, yeah. And usually encounters sperm in the fallopian tube and that's where fertilization usually
Starting point is 00:20:44
happens. And then it takes a few more days for the embryo now or pre-embryo to travel down the rest of the tube into the uterus and hopefully implant if it's normal. Now, one of the most interesting things here that is worth repeating even though we talked about it last week in case anybody missed it, how many sperm is the egg encountering at the time of fertilization? Millions. Yeah, millions. So, why is it – I know the answer to this question, but it is so cool.
Starting point is 00:21:13
Why is it that one and only one sperm out of millions or even less than that, but let's just say it's hundreds of thousands, why does only one get to transmit its genetic material into that egg? Well, once an egg is fertilized, there's sort of a chemical reaction, if you will, that happens that prevents any other sperm from fertilizing the eggs, because that would be bad. You only want one sperm and one egg to combine. Yeah. There's like an electrical force field that immediately activates around the egg.
Starting point is 00:21:43
I find this so fascinating. Yeah, it so fascinating. Yeah, it is fascinating. And brilliant. OK, so now, and by the way, what is the relative size of an egg to a sperm? The egg is actually much bigger than the sperm. I don't know exactly in microns how big it is.
Starting point is 00:21:56
I feel like I used to know this answer. And it's shocking how disparate they are in size. The egg is, I believe, the biggest cell on the body potentially. I've checked on that, but I believe that's true. All right. So yeah, you have this massive egg that's basically like the sun and like this tiny little sperm, which is like the earth and colliding with it.
Starting point is 00:22:15
Okay. So, fertilization takes place and how long from impact until you have that single cell zygote that actually has a lined up pair of chromosomes. Is that a matter of hours? Yeah, within a few hours, yeah. Okay. And then what is the process that occurs for cell division for when that zygote goes from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 cells?
Starting point is 00:22:40
So A, how long does that take? And B, at what point does it implant into the uterus? Dr. Kirsten Kiefer Most of what we know actually about this is from in vitro fertilization or IVF because we can actually see that happening in the petri dish. So usually with IVF, an egg is fertilized with sperm. By the next day, we can see if it's fertilized and we know if it's fertilized because it has what we call two pronuclei, so DNA from the sperm and DNA from the egg.
Starting point is 00:23:12
And then over the course of the next couple of days, it divides into maybe six to eight cells, so about three days after fertilization, it's six to eight cells, and then by five to six days, it's about 60 to 80 cells. And that's the stage where it implants in the uterus. So five, six days after fertilization. So with that said, now that we have a pretty good understanding of what all needs to happen for fertilization and implantation, What is the biggest risk to that?
Starting point is 00:23:48
And when does it cease to become a zygote, by the way? I don't remember any of my terminology here. You have zygotes and blastospheres or blastocytes or- Yeah, yeah. A zygote, I think, is still a single cell that's fertilized, an egg and sperm combined. Then it starts to divide. We call it a pre-embryo. And then by two weeks, we call it an embryo.
Starting point is 00:24:08
But in IVF, we call it an embryo even in the first few days. – Assuming that we have chromosomal alignment, it's two weeks out. So we have a two-week-old embryo that is implanted, what is the greatest risk that is faced by that embryo to coming to fruition as a fetus? In fact, going all the way into the third trimester. So in other words, we've taken the biggest risk off the table, which is aneuploidy. What are the other risks it faces? So once a pregnancy is established, you mean?
Starting point is 00:24:41
Yes. So if it's a normal embryo, chances are pretty good that it continues to term. So let's define normal. So normal at the macro level means chromosomally normal. What else requires normality? Any other genetic issues that get in the way here? There are other genes that play a role in embryo development. Those are less understood, but there are certainly other genes involved.
Starting point is 00:25:03
So you could have a chromosomally normal embryo that fails to develop for other reasons. And then there could be uterine factors that also play a role. So an embryo may implant, but if there's some structural abnormality, for example, in the uterus, maybe that pregnancy can't continue and may result in a miscarriage. Got it. Okay. So let's talk about a patient that comes to you, they're gonna say we're having difficulty conceiving. What are the questions you have to render the diagnosis
Starting point is 00:25:34
of infertility, meaning we need some intervention, versus, hmm, you just need to make a few adjustments in something and I'm not willing to put the label of infertility on. Would that be the first bifurcation in thinking? Yeah, we want to take a full medical history, both partners, if it's a couple, and that includes medical history, reproductive history, psychosocial history, sexual history, all those things are important, lifestyle factors, we ask about all those things.
Starting point is 00:26:06
And the definition of infertility is trying for about a year, so unprotected, and of course, for about a year without success. That's the medical definition of infertility. But we start our testing after a year in women who are less than 35 and after six months if a woman is older than 35. Even though it may take longer to get pregnant if you're older, if there's something wrong, you kind of want to know about it sooner rather than later. So if a couple female partners over 35
Starting point is 00:26:37
and they've been trying, having time intercourse at the right time and still not pregnant, then we would initiate some preliminary investigations. On the female side, what's most important usually is we want to ask about the woman's menstrual cycles. Are they regular? Is she tracking ovulation?
Starting point is 00:26:55
Does it look like she's ovulating, et cetera? The male side, we want to ask about sexual function. They had a semen analysis. If not, we usually order one because we're interested in the sperm concentration, the motility of the sperm, the shape of the sperm, those types of things. One of the things I was very surprised by in the podcast that we did last week on male fertility
Starting point is 00:27:16
was how infrequently men are getting evaluated and how many missed opportunities. In other words, how much wasted time is being generated because infertility is being assumed to be the responsibility of the female. Responsibility might be the wrong word, but it's just assumed that, well, that's more likely where it is. And so through no bad intention, the guy is not getting evaluated when in reality the issue could have been with him all along and time is wasted.
Starting point is 00:27:43
Right. When you look at the data, it's about a third of the time it's a female factor, a third of the time it's a male factor, and another third of the time it's some combination of male and female factors. So yes, definitely one of the first things that we do is the semen analysis on the male partner. And do you guys do that yourselves as well? We do. At the fertility clinic. Okay, great. If there is an abnormality, we usually refer that male partner to a reproductive urologist for further evaluation.
Starting point is 00:28:11
But these days, it's recommended actually that men, even if they're not trying to get pregnant, sometimes assess their semen and analysis. And because it can be a marker of other health problems, just like a woman's menstrual cycle can be a marker of other health problems. I should qualify that one-year timeframe. If you have some reason to believe that you have a fertility problem, I wouldn't necessarily
Starting point is 00:28:30
wait a whole year and then go see a provider. If your cycles are irregular, if you think you might have pleistococcal ovary syndrome or something, then you definitely want to see somebody sooner than a year. Soterios Johnson Is it possible to say anything about fertility rates changing over the past 50 years? Is there any statement you can make on that? 07. Yeah, there's some data that seems to suggest that infertility rates are increasing over
Starting point is 00:28:53
the last several years. It's pretty common. I don't know if your listeners know, but about the lifetime risk of infertility for each person is about one in six. So that's close to 20%. In the last few years in the United States seems to be kind of a plateau of the prevalence. Let me just ask a clarifying question, Paula. So if a woman gets pregnant in her 20s, but then in her 30s meets the criteria for infertility, would she be considered one of those one in
Starting point is 00:29:22
six? Yeah. So we're going to say that the one in six means someone who wants to get pregnant at a certain point in their life can't. Exactly. Lifetime prevalence. Exactly.
Starting point is 00:29:33
As far as the reasons for the increase in infertility prevalence, it's not super well understood. Part of the reason is delayed childbearing. I was just about to say, you could make it 100% if every woman decides to have a baby when she's 70. By definition, you have 100% fertility. Exactly, exactly. In fertility, yeah.
Starting point is 00:29:50
So women are waiting longer, of course, to start their families, to pursue education, careers, et cetera. Maybe they haven't found the right partner. And so that definitely is contributing to increased rates of fertility. There's some data that show that sperm counts are decreasing globally.
Starting point is 00:30:05
It's a little controversial, but that might be plain and rule. It might be slight increase risk in sexually transmitted diseases as well. So all those things are probably factors. Is there an analysis that's tried to get at this by normalizing to female age? Because it seems to me that if you could say, rather than make it lifetime prevalence, because that's going to be subject to all the problems you could say, rather than make it lifetime prevalence,
Starting point is 00:30:25
because that's going to be subject to all the problems you've stated, but what if we just said, for women aged 28 to 32, 32 to 35, like if we made narrow buckets of age, we could get a better sense of whether there's a true infertility issue. Has that analysis been done? It's definitely been looked at by age.
Starting point is 00:30:47
I don't know the data off the top of my head if it's been looked at by age over time. But definitely, your chance of infertility is higher if you're 40 compared to if you're 20 or even. But do we know if a 30-year-old woman today has a higher rate of infertility than a 30-year-old woman 50 years ago? We think so, but I don't know that data off the top of my head.
Starting point is 00:31:11
If the answer there is yes, I don't know that it would answer all our questions because it could still be explained by decreasing sperm count. It could still be explained by increasing paternal age. This would be a very difficult analysis to do. Right. Environmental factors as well. Our exposures are different now than they were 50 years ago. Well, and then the question, of course, would be if this is an environmental reason, what
Starting point is 00:31:34
are the environmental triggers? Now, you mentioned STDs a minute ago. How do STDs and which STDs play a role in fertility? The ones most well understood are probably gonorrhea and chlamydia, which are very common sexually transmitted diseases. And on the female side, those particular infections can ascend to the fallopian tubes and cause scarring in the fallopian tubes, which then interfere with that process that we talked about earlier, the egg and the sperm meeting, and can lead to infertility.
Starting point is 00:32:04
And is that something that happens if it is infertility. And is that something that happens if it is left untreated or is that something that's easy to address with antibiotics if caught early? I mean, if it's caught early, then it's usually treatable with antibiotics or there are some issues with antibiotic resistance, especially with gonorrhea. But usually if you catch it early, it's treatable.
Starting point is 00:32:22
But if it's late stage or it's unrecognized or untreated, then it's more likely to ascend to the fallopian tubes where it usually caused fertility problems. How prevalent is gonorrhea today in the US? I think it's pretty common. I don't know. Really? Yeah.
Starting point is 00:32:36
Yeah. In certain populations, it's more common than others, but unfortunately. And there's a number of reasons for that. Some of it is just lack of awareness and education about safe sex practices, maybe less testing as well, especially if you saw that during the pandemic for sure. How does it present?
Starting point is 00:32:54
In women usually with pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge, those are the most common symptoms. And is it equally transmissible from male to female and female to male? It's probably more transmissible from male to female. OK. And is it an STD where the person who has it knows, like if a male has it, does he know he has it?
Starting point is 00:33:18
Not always. Presumably not if it's being transmitted this readily. Yeah, not always. What about HSV? Does that factor into fertility at all? Not as much. And chlamydia, again, I apologize for my ignorance. I just don't remember any of this stuff
Starting point is 00:33:32
since taking the USMLE exams. Tell me how chlamydia presents and how it impacts fertility. The same, actually. Yeah, very similarly. So pelvic pain, fever, usually they're both present together. And does it have the same pathology where it creates, it ascends the fallopian tubes and scars the tubes? Yep.
Starting point is 00:33:51
So, worst case scenario, if a woman undergoes a severe infection with one or both of these, it's not treated in time, she has completely scarred fallopian tubes, is it still likely that she could get pregnant through IVF? Are the eggs and uterus still preserved enough to... Yes, yes. It doesn't usually affect the uterus or the eggs or the ovaries.
Starting point is 00:34:14
Now she may not know that she has blocked tubes until she starts trying because you wouldn't necessarily feel different if your tubes were blocked. So one of the tests we were talking earlier about what testing we might do in addition to a semen analysis and getting menstrual history etc. is we usually do an x-ray test that's called a Hystrocell Pingogram or HSG for short and it's done specifically to evaluate whether or not the tubes are open. So are you just injecting contrast? I assume you do this externally. You go into the cervix into the you just inject dye and take I assume you do this externally, you go into the cervix,
Starting point is 00:34:45
you just inject dye and take an x-ray. Exactly. And you're looking for how smooth, and so tell me what does a normal fallopian tube look like on that test? So first the dye, so it's done in radiology facility usually by radiologists, although some gynecologists do this test as well, but usually it fills up the uterus, so you can also see the uterus. And then the tubes are kind of like these wire-like.
Starting point is 00:35:07
What's the diameter of a normal fallopian tube in that setting? Less than a centimeter, yeah. That's pretty big. Yeah, the whole tube, but the actual opening is- No, yeah. How big is the lumen? Microns. Oh, wow.
Starting point is 00:35:20
Okay. Or millimeters. I don't know. Exactly. But you can see it. Definitely see it on x-ray, and you can see the- Well, if you can see it, it's probably a millimeter or more than not a micron. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Okay.
Starting point is 00:35:30
And then the dye is filling up the tubes and then spilling out the tubes. So you can see that process. Right. The ovaries are not visualized because of the finger-like projection. So it's actually spilling dye into the peritoneum at this point. Right. Okay. Based on that visual inspection, a trained radiologist and GYN can say that is smooth,
Starting point is 00:35:47
that looks great versus that is jagged and or obstructed. Right. Now, if it's obstructed, I assume that the woman has a much bigger problem, which is every month one of those eggs comes out, it's not getting past the point. Is it just atrophy and get reabsorbed? Yeah. I see. So it wouldn't necessarily cause pain?
Starting point is 00:36:08
No. By the way, we didn't talk about this earlier. We took it for granted. This is happening with two separate sides. Yeah. And it's just mind-boggling to me that there is one that is being selected and the one that's happening in one side, somehow that signal is making it to the other side to say, you can't do it this month.
Starting point is 00:36:23
Right. How does that happen? Who knows? We don't know. We have no idea. No idea Something to do with the receptors on the eggs and particular hormonal milieu. Maybe there's some Nerve that plays a role. We have no idea actually, but it is on average 50% from one side and 50% from the other side. And it's a coin toss. Right. And it's not necessarily alternating, but it's on average.
Starting point is 00:36:49
Right. It would be like heads is left, tails is right. If you throw it for enough times, it's 50-50, but not necessarily back to back. Exactly. This is mind boggling to me. Yeah, it's fascinating. It's mind boggling if it were just one ovary,
Starting point is 00:37:02
but the fact that these things are physically a foot apart, not a foot, but half a foot apart, and some signal is transmitted in this woman's body. Yep. I mean, it's... Yeah, yeah. We don't quite understand it. That's incredible.
Starting point is 00:37:17
Yeah. Or whatever that egg that's being selected somehow develops the appropriate receptors or whatever that only it can respond to the hormones. It's not necessarily signaling to the other ones, but something is happening to that one that's being selected that's making it the so-called dominant follicle for that cycle. Yeah, I suppose that's a more likely and plausible scenario, is that something stochastically triggers one and only one to develop a high enough receptor concentration for FSH or LH or something, so that it becomes the only one that,
Starting point is 00:37:55
it's the only one that develops the radar. Right, now of course when we do in vitro fertilization, we're giving much higher doses of FSH, and multiple eggs are growing. So you can overcome this process and get multiple eggs to grow, but we don't totally understand physiologically what makes just one grow each month. Okay. Let's say you do the analysis, and I assume if there's scarring on one side but not the
Starting point is 00:38:20
other, would you intervene or would you just say, no, we're just going to take twice as long for one to get through? Yeah, there's still a chance to get pregnant, although whatever process caused the scarring in the one tube probably affected the other tube as well. So just because it's open doesn't mean that it's functioning normally. Certainly can give it a few months of trying, but the other issue you have to worry about is what we call an ectopic pregnancy. If that tube is not normal, if fertilization happens, that embryo can implant in the tube.
Starting point is 00:38:51
And that's kind of a very dangerous situation because obviously the tube can accommodate a pregnancy. So usually that causes pain and if it goes unrecognized. It's a surgical emergency. Yeah, exactly. At how many weeks of gestation is a woman typically? Because I did my training in general surgery, so that was one of the things we were always thinking about
Starting point is 00:39:11
was ectopic pregnancies for women presenting with abdominal pain. But I don't think I know the answer to this question, which is how many weeks of gestation is a woman when she's showing up in the ER complaining of abdominal pain? Usually about six to eight weeks of pregnancy. Two months pregnant. Right.
Starting point is 00:39:27
Now, remember we time pregnancy from like two weeks before ovulation. So by the time she recognizes she's pregnant, she's already a month pregnant. So in the next month is probably the most common time where those ectopic pregnancies present. So when a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, can that fallopian tube be salvaged?
Starting point is 00:39:48
Sometimes. Sometimes if you recognize it early, it can be treated either medically or surgically, and that tube can be salvaged. If you recognize it late and the tube ruptures, then oftentimes the treatment is to just remove the tube, plus especially if it's not functioning normally. Yeah, so when you remove that, let's just say it's a young woman, she's 25 years old,
Starting point is 00:40:07
you can't salvage the tube, you end up taking the tube, you're leaving the ovary, so you still want her to have her endocrine system intact. What's happening to the eggs that come out of that tube? They just get released into the abdomen, the peritoneum, and resort. So do you tell that woman your fertility rate just went down by 50%?
Starting point is 00:40:24
Yeah, she can still get pregnant if she has the other tube intact, So, do you tell that woman your fertility rate just went down by 50%? Yeah. She can still get pregnant if she has the other tube intact, but most of the time if the egg ovulates from the right, it's going to try and go down the right side. Although there have been cases where you can ovulate from the right ovary and it can travel down. It makes its way over to the other phalloping tube. Makes its way over there. Yeah, it's rare.
Starting point is 00:40:43
Wow. But it could happen. What are the risks for ectopic pregnancy besides former STDs that lead to scarring in the tube? Previous surgery, pelvic surgery in particular, like a ruptured appendix or something like that, endometriosis can cause scarring of the tubes. Those are probably the most common. Okay, any genetic component to this?
Starting point is 00:41:01
If your mom had an ectopic pregnancy or you? Not that we know of. So let's go back to our hypothetical case here. So woman comes in, let's just assume for the sake of simplicity, the workup on her male partner, totally fine. His sperm are fine. The radiograph shows that she has,
Starting point is 00:41:20
at least to the eye, normal fallopian tubes. What's the next step in the workup? So we want to assess her cycles and ovulation. So if she's ovulating regularly, then we call that sort of unexplained. And how do you know that she is? Is that determined by the fact that she has a regular period? Does that alone tell you that?
Starting point is 00:41:40
Usually. Usually. It would be unusual to have regular periods and not be ovulating, but it could happen. How stringent is your definition for a regular period? It's not 28 days necessarily? Not necessarily, yeah.
Starting point is 00:41:52
There's a range. It could be anywhere from like 21 to 35 days or so. Wow. That's a pretty big range. Are you less concerned with the number of days of the cycle and more concerned with the fact that whatever the days are, it's just repeating over and over again? Yes. If you mean duration with the number of days of the cycle and more concerned with the fact that whatever the days are, it's just repeating over and over again? Yes, if you mean duration of the period.
Starting point is 00:42:09
Correct. Yeah, that's not as important as how frequently the period is happening. Even if it was 21 days, but it was always 21 days, that's better than, it's 24, 28, 31. There is some normal variations. Sometimes I'll see a patient who'll say, my periods are very irregular. Sometimes they're 26 days, sometimes they're 32.
Starting point is 00:42:28
I consider that normal. It's not usually always 28 days or always 21 days. There's some normal variation. Irregular would be your skipping months or maybe you're getting a period every three months or four months. And what's happening in that situation in a young woman? There are a number of different causes. Probably the most common is something called polycystic ovary syndrome.
Starting point is 00:42:50
It's a very common hormonal condition. We don't know exactly what causes it. I feel like I'm saying that a lot about women's health. We don't know exactly what causes it because we're not investing enough in women's research. Why do you think that is? This came up on another podcast on HRT, which is another one of my big rallying cries, which is how pathetic it is.
Starting point is 00:43:11
Why do you think this is, given how important a subject this is? Political reasons, I think, gender inequality, all kinds of reasons like that. Do we have a sense objectively that there is a difference in this type of research, or do we think a sense objectively that there is a difference in this type of research or do we think it's just that, well, maybe there's equal amounts of funding,
Starting point is 00:43:31
but the innate problems associated with the female reproductive system or female health in general are so much more complicated that at equal funding levels, we're gonna be far behind in our understanding. Yeah, no, I think it's the former. You think it's objectively. Oh, there's good data that the funding for women's health
Starting point is 00:43:48
research, it's like 10%. Of the overall NIH budget, for example, it's very small. If you look at reproductive health, it's even smaller. So it's a huge issue. Let's talk about polycystic ovarian syndrome. So what's the prevalence of it in, let's say, women aged, call it 15 to 30? Yeah, super common.
Starting point is 00:44:07
About six to 8% of women will have polycystic ovarian syndrome. Most common symptoms are irregular periods, also evidence of high androgen levels, and that can usually present with acne or excess hair growth. We call that heresotism, obesity or being overweight, that's also part of the syndrome.
Starting point is 00:44:27
The androgens are specifically just testosterone, just DHEA, DHEA, all of the above? Both, yeah, both, but typically elevated testosterone from the ovaries. Is that the cause or the effect? We don't know. We don't know, but it's definitely seen in almost all women with PCOS that they have higher androgen levels. And why is PCOS seemingly also highly associated with insulin resistance? Again, we don't know exactly, but we think the androgens play a role.
Starting point is 00:44:59
We think there might be some genetic factors that play a role. I don't know that we understand why, but we certainly have recognized in the last several decades that most women with PCOS also happen to be insulin resistant. But we don't know the direction of causality? No. We know that not everybody who's insulin resistant
Starting point is 00:45:20
has PCOS, of course. Not all diabetics are insulin resistant. But we also know that some women with PCOS are not insulin resistant, correct? Probably on some level they are, but they're able to compensate. And certainly it's more likely if they tend to be overweight as well. So it's definitely multifactorial. My guess is like we're treating PCOS now more like other complex diseases like obesity or hypertension, et cetera.
Starting point is 00:45:45
There's lots of things going on. But based on what you just said, if there is any causality between them, it's more likely that the PCOS is driving the insulin resistance than the other way around, given the number of women that are insulin resistant who do not have PCOS. Yeah, that's probably true. So then the question is, what do we need to do to treat PCOS. Yeah, that's probably true. So then the question is, what do we need to do to treat PCOS? So it depends on the goal of the patient. So if they're trying to get pregnant, there's one set of treatments.
Starting point is 00:46:14
If they're not trying to get pregnant but they have PCOS, then we usually focus on their cycles because it's generally not a good idea to go too long in between cycles because what can happen is the lining of the uterus can overgrow. If it overgrows too much, it can become what we call hyperplastic, worst case scenario, cancer. So you definitely don't want that. So it's important to be shedding that lining or to be on hormonal suppression so that that doesn't happen. If the goal is to treat the hyperandrogenic symptoms like the acne and the hirsutism, again hormonal treatments usually effective for that. When you say hormonal treatments, you mean like spironolactone and things like that?
Starting point is 00:46:51
We usually start with birth control pills. Birth control pills very effective for most symptoms of PCOS. It'll regulate the cycles, decrease androgen levels, help with hirsutism and acne, et cetera. So let's talk about why. So a birth control pill is a high dose of a synthetic estrogen and progestin. Correct. That's given 21 days and then paused for a week, meaning you take it every day but the last week is a placebo. So is the reason that that helps with the hyper androgenism because it raises sex hormone binding globulins so much that it mops up all the excess testosterone?
Starting point is 00:47:27
Part of the reason. I'm impressed by your endocrinology knowledge. Yes, that's part of the reason. And by the way, you can take it that way you described where you have a bleed every month, but you don't have to. Many people take it continuously these days so you don't have a period at all. But then doesn't that address the issue that you were talking about or does the synthetic estrogen, the synthetic progestin offset the hyperplasia
Starting point is 00:47:50
and then you don't care? Right. When you take the combination of estrogen and progesterone, usually the lining becomes quite thin. Thin anyway. You don't have to worry about it. Yeah. So two mechanisms of action.
Starting point is 00:47:59
When you're taking those high doses of estrogen and progesterone, it's suppressing the pituitary hormones, namely the LH and FSH. But the LH is what drives the testosterone production in the ovary. So that's one mechanism. And the other one is the one you described. So the estrogen component of the pill will increase the sex hormone binding globulin, so you have less free testosterone around.
Starting point is 00:48:20
So again, that will help with those symptoms we talked about. Okay. So, woman with PCOS doesn't want to get pregnant, just wants to reduce the androgen impact and protect her uterus. A constant oral contraceptive is a great strategy. A great strategy. Yeah. There are others. Could be a progestin IUD. That's a hormonally active IUD. So, there are a number of different ones. We're just a progestin IUD. That's a hormonally active IUD. So there are a number of different ones. We're just taking progesterone every few months. That usually will help protect the lining, but probably won't decrease the androgen levels. And how often do you place women who have PCOS also with insulin resistance on metformin?
Starting point is 00:48:59
Do you find that or any of the other diabetic agents to be particularly useful? Occasionally, yeah. And that's an important point because women, as we said, who have PCOS are insulin resistant, which predisposes them to diabetes. So those women need to be screened periodically for diabetes. And we commonly use metformin to either treat pre-diabetes or to try and prevent diabetes. Does insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes independently impair fertility? All things being equal?
Starting point is 00:49:29
Absent PCOS, that's a loaded question. Yeah. In some cases, I mean, there's some data that shows that metabolic diseases or chronic diseases can impact fertility. Mechanisms, again, are unclear, but probably related to both ovulation dysfunction and also endometrial receptivity.
Starting point is 00:49:48
Okay. So, now, I assume that's the easier way to treat PCOS is the woman who does not want to get pregnant. So, now, let's talk about the woman with PCOS, but who is also trying to conceive. What is your playbook? So, we always counsel these patients as well. I should mention whether they're trying to get pregnant or is your playbook? So we always count on these patients as well. I should mention whether they're trying to get pregnant or not, especially if they're overweight or obese,
Starting point is 00:50:10
weight loss helps with all the symptoms of PCOS. So healthy diet, lifestyle, et cetera. And how much of a role are GLP-1 agonists playing in this now? How much more success are you having with treating PCOS that way? Yeah, increasingly. And they're very successful, as you know, for weight loss. And there have been some studies on PCOS patients specifically very effective.
Starting point is 00:50:30
Do you know any of those data? I'm not familiar with them. Yeah, they work really well, just like they work in people with diabetes or people with obesity without diabetes. The problem is you can't get pregnant while you're taking them. And the current recommendation is
Starting point is 00:50:43
to stop for at least two months. And pardon my ignorance, why? Because we don't have any data on whether they're safe. Yeah, so FDA is saying, I forget the FDA's classification for this. There's like A, B, C, X, or something like that for every drug? Yes, I haven't looked for that one specifically, but I'm sure it's X because we have no data. That's an important message for anybody listening.
Starting point is 00:51:03
If you're trying to get pregnant, you should not be on a GLP-1 agonist because we don't understand the impact of that. Right. You can be on it pre-pregnancy, just the recommendation is to stop for at least two months. Now, having said that, there have been lots of, you may have read about, azembaic babies, like people getting pregnant on GLP-1. So there is a registry. And so far, to my knowledge knowledge there haven't been reported birth defects
Starting point is 00:51:26
and that type of thing. But obviously we're talking about small number. Yeah, that's an interesting point. And now that you mentioned that, I now recall hearing about that. So presumably these are women who have taken either semiglutide, trisepatide, and presumably they get pregnant. Yes. Either intentionally or not.
Starting point is 00:51:44
So that's a very interesting registry to follow. Right. Now, of course, once they find out they're pregnant, usually they stop. They're usually counseled to stop. Yeah. So we don't know what would happen if you continue. I don't think anybody wants to do that study at the moment. Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
Starting point is 00:51:58
Certainly don't want women who are pregnant to not want to eat. Okay. Understanding that a woman who's got PCOS is going to be first counseled to make these changes that effectively help her lose weight and increase her metabolic health. Let's say she is somewhat successful, but still unable to address the concern. Luckily, there are very good ovulation-inducing medications available. What we would typically recommend for someone with PCOS to help them ovulate more regularly
Starting point is 00:52:28
is a medication called Letrazole. The brand name is Famara. It's just a medication you take for five days in your cycle and then we can usually assess ovulation with ultrasound. And what does it do? Basically, it's a category of medication called aromatase inhibitors, which blocks the... Conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
Starting point is 00:52:47
Right. Androgens to estrogen. That lower estrogen somehow triggers the pituitary to increase secretion of FSH and LH, and that stimulates the ovary to, again, get one of those follicles. And is the reason you use something like an aromatase inhibitor as opposed to Clomaphene or HCG is just that it's a smaller nudge and you're starting out with it? No. We used to use Clomid first line for PCOS, but then there was a study that came out several
Starting point is 00:53:17
years ago comparing the two and showed the pregnancy rates were a little bit higher with Letrozole. Clomid's perfectly good as well, but letrozole is better for PCOS. So if you have access to letrozole... That's very counterintuitive. If you think about it, when you take an aromatase inhibitor, you're going to lower estrogen but not... I mean, I guess it depends on the dose.
Starting point is 00:53:37
I guess I'm trying to think of like anastrozole, which I'm more familiar with than letrozole. I suppose if you took a milligram of anastrozole every day for five days, you would drive estrogen down. But I didn't think that that reduction in estrogen would lead to a high enough amount of gonadotropin releasing hormone, which is effectively what has to be happening. It has to be going up to drive the secretion of LH and FSH.
Starting point is 00:54:03
Right. Yeah. Yeah, again, that's still counterintuitive to me. I would just think that giving 50 to 100 milligrams of Clomid would have a much bigger impact on that. It also works, but when they compare them, yeah, randomized control trial, head to head comparison show the pregnancy rates were better for some reason
Starting point is 00:54:21
with the letrozole compared to Clomid. OK, and does it matter when in her cycle she takes the letrozole compared to Clement. Okay, and does it matter when in her cycle she takes the letrozole? Usually it's recommended from day three to five with the first day of full bleeding, we call that day one. What if the whole point of this is she's not having her period,
Starting point is 00:54:37
how do you then time it? We induce a period, not a real period, but we induce a withdrawal bleed by giving progesterone typically. Okay, so you give a woman progesterone and then by withdrawing the progesterone, that's so cool. Yeah. You guys are so manipulative.
Starting point is 00:54:53
I know. How much do you give? 200? No, five to 10 milligrams of myoxyprogesterone acetate or you can give micronized progesterone for about seven to 10 days. Only five to 10 milligrams of micronized progesterone for about seven to 10 days. Only five to 10 milligrams of micronized progesterone? No, micronized progesterone, 200 milligrams. Yes, OK, OK, yes.
Starting point is 00:55:10
So you give the full party dose of micronized progesterone for five days. Madroxyprogesterone acetate, five to 10 milligrams. So then, by the way, do you have a preference for MPA versus micronized? No, not really. OK. Because it's such a short course.
Starting point is 00:55:22
So you give the full dose of endometrial progesterone for five days. The second you take it off, it's the withdrawal of progesterone that causes the lining to shed and then we call that day one and then you said on day five we go ahead and start ripening the follicle with the aromatase inhibitor. Three to seven. Yeah. Day three to seven. For five days.
Starting point is 00:55:43
Wow. Very cool. Yeah. And then we usually do an ultrasound around day 12-ish. for five days. 06. 07. 08. 09. 010. 011. 012. 013. 014. 015.
Starting point is 00:55:51
016. 017. 018. 019. 021. 021. 021. 021.
Starting point is 00:55:59
021. 021. 021. 021. 021. 021. 021. 021. 021. 021. Every single woman out there with PCOS who wants to get pregnant has access to a doctor that understands what you just described and can do that for her. Or do you worry that too many women are being shunted to IVF too soon without an attempt
Starting point is 00:56:15
at something like this? I definitely think there are probably not enough people who totally understand management of PCOS, especially in the context of fertility treatment, for sure. And even in the context of non-infertility treatment, often what I hear from patients is they had irregular periods, somebody told them to start to go on the birth control pill, they never told them why, they didn't even know what they had PCOS. Happens to be the correct treatment, so great, but they've gone years now not understanding
Starting point is 00:56:45
that they have PCOS and the implications of that, which as we talked about, there are metabolic implications, et cetera. So that's a problem. But once they want to become pregnant, very few general gynecologists are set up to be able to treat patients with either Clomid or Lutriazole. Some of them do, but it's not like a fertility clinic
Starting point is 00:57:06
with reproductive endocrinologists, because we're set up to do monitoring seven days a week and that type of thing. But not everybody has access to a fertility specialist, very dependent on where you live. A little bit better now with telehealth, but still. Do you have to do the sonogram when you're doing this? You don't have to, but you want to know whether the woman's responding, meaning that she's
Starting point is 00:57:29
actually ovulating. There are other ways to assess that. If she gets a period at the right time, then she's probably ovulated, or if she gets pregnant, of course. Or you can check her progesterone level in the lute-neal phase, the second half of the cycle, and if it's elevated, she's probably ovulated. We just happen to use ultrasounds just easier. 06.
Starting point is 00:57:48
S0 And how much of what you're describing is covered with typical health insurance? 07. Kind of depends where you live. In the United States, it's very state dependent. Some states have infertility insurance mandates where your employer's insurance policy has to provide infertility, diagnostic, and treatment, but many states infertility is not covered or they might just cover the testing portion but then not cover the treatment portion.
Starting point is 00:58:13
So that's a huge problem. You're in Oregon. I'm in Oregon. What is the state there? We don't have an infertility insurance mandate yet, although we're working on it. It's actually a bill in session, this regular session now that we're trying to get passed because infertility is a disease like every other disease and we think it should matter where you live, you should have access to the appropriate treatment. So in our state it
Starting point is 00:58:37
kind of depends on your employer and whether they provide that particular insurance coverage. And so if a person has health insurance that does not cover reproductive care, how much would be the cost of what you just described? The out-of-pocket cost. Yeah, so let's resolve in Clomid or just oral medications.
Starting point is 00:58:55
Yeah, they're cheap drugs. They're pretty cheap, yeah. But then you add the ultrasound monitoring, that could be another $300 if you're paying out-of-pocket. And then if you're doing intrauterine insemination, for example, which we haven't talked about. Let's just say just what we talked about is still a really cheap treatment, right?
Starting point is 00:59:10
Relatively, yes. A few hundred dollars a month. For some people, that would be a lot. But relative to what we're about to talk about, this is still well within the purview of out of pocket. For sure, compared to... Compared to what's coming. Yeah. For sure.
Starting point is 00:59:23
And so you kind of alluded to it, but I'm guessing you're saying, look, we would give this three tries. Would that be a fair assessment? Usually, yeah. So we'd go through three consecutive cycles of this. It's interesting. So there's two ways that this treatment could fail.
Starting point is 00:59:37
The first is each time we did the ultrasound, we just didn't see an egg. Right. Not responding. We were not responding to the follicle stimulation. Right. Let's talk about what the implication is there. Alternatively, you could say, god, three out of three months, we actually got ovulation, but we didn't get fertilization.
Starting point is 00:59:57
If you were three months of that, I assume in parallel, you're doing the male workup, because nothing would be a greater crime than going to all that trouble, and then you figured out the sperm was the problem. But let's assume you have that box checked. Would you be more inclined to continue that treatment for another three to six months? Yeah, yeah.
Starting point is 01:00:15
And someone who hasn't been ovulating, they haven't tried for a year even. They haven't even met the criteria. Right, right, exactly. So there's nothing magic about three months, but that's at least a check-in point, where we say, hey, do we continue doing this or do we move on to something else? So if it's a young person and this is like the first time they're ovulating in their life, then yeah, we give them more time on a less invasive treatment, less expensive treatment.
Starting point is 01:00:39
If they're like 38, 40, we probably move on to something else. Okay. So let's go to the first case I described. So you get no ovulation. Okay. Three times no ovulation. We're not going to waste her time anymore, but she's still young. So what's your next step in the algorithm? Typically, so assuming we've tried higher doses and different medication like Clomid or whatever, and she's still not responding, then we typically move on to a class of medication
Starting point is 01:01:05
called gonadotropins or essentially FSH or follicle stimulating hormones, same hormone. Adam Bilyeu Not LH. You don't give HCG directly? Dr. Julie Kinn It's a little bit of combination. We do eventually give HCG to trigger ovulation. So we could either use those medications with either timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination or with IVF. That middle option with time intercourse and intrauterine insemination has kind of fallen out of favor a little bit because those medications are very expensive, require a lot of monitoring,
Starting point is 01:01:38
success rate with IUI or time intercourse is much lower than IVF. So we usually skip that and go directly to IVF. Okay, if you are going to use FSH and LH, give me a sense of cost. What dose are you using of HCG? So if the plan is just for time intercourse and pre-during insemination, we use maybe one to three ampules of FSH and 75 units.
Starting point is 01:02:05
The whole cycle, if you include the monitoring, maybe one to three ampules of FSH in 75 units. The whole cycle, if you include the monitoring, the IEY, et cetera, could be like three or $4,000. So you can see- Yeah, we're a big step up. Yeah, after a few cycles, it's almost the same cost as an IVF cycle, so you're like better off, especially if the patient wants to have, or the couple wants to have more than one child.
Starting point is 01:02:24
The advantage of IVF is you can freeze embryos. So if you want to have two or three kids, might as well just do IVF and bank those embryos because otherwise you're going to have to do the same thing all over again for your second kid or third kid. Yeah. I see. So basically intrauterine insemination has largely fallen out of favor. Does that also mean the cost of IVF is coming down?
Starting point is 01:02:45
Is that also making it more attractive? No, so IUI is very common still. I see. But we do it, we were talking specifically about the patient with PCOS who does it. Who's not ovulating. Right. Got it. But otherwise, and if you have a patient who is ovulating and has maybe unexplained infertility tubes are open. Yeah, in this case, you don't have to use a hormone to make her ovulate. You just need an ultrasound, which is relatively cheap to know when she's going to ovulate. Yeah, we still use the medication though because we super ovulate. So normally you just make one egg. So when someone's already ovulating, the goal of the fertility medications is to
Starting point is 01:03:22
get them to release more than one egg. So two eggs, three eggs, more eggs around, higher chance that one of them is going to be normal and one is going to fertilize. What does the graph look like of number of eggs versus probability of twins, triplets, et cetera? That's one of the downsides. So, the risk of multiples with the oral medications like Clomid or Letrozole is about 5 to 8 percent. So not super high, but definitely higher than patients were to conceive without medication. So that's something we counsel them about.
Starting point is 01:03:55
But it's very common as a first-line treatment to do oral medication with IUI, even in the context of normal sperm, I would say, although it's more important, of course, if there's a male component. And then if that didn't work in three cycles, then move on to IVF. And with the injectables, what is the risk of multiple pregnancies? Much higher, 25 to 35%.
Starting point is 01:04:18
And how many eggs are typically? It depends on the dose of the medication. So of course, when we're doing IVF, we want a lot of eggs. So it's 10 to 15 eggs. But yeah, but if we're doing IUI, it could be like three to five eggs. It depends on the dose and depends on the age of the patient, et cetera. So what's fallen out of favor is injectables with IUI. We don't do that very much.
Starting point is 01:04:41
Got it. Makes sense. Back in the day when every time you were in the grocery store and you saw the cover of the National Enquirer, and there was like, this woman just had 47 babies. Like, what the hell was going on in those eras? I think in the early days of IVF, well, even before IVF when people just
Starting point is 01:04:57
had access to injectables and IUI, most of the multiple pregnancies were not from IVF, but from injectables and IUI. Because literally there were women having eight and nine babies at a time. Yeah, that famous Oktopoulos case, I think that was actually an IVF case. So in the early days of IVF, when IVF was not very successful, we had to transfer many embryos to get decent pregnancy rates. And some of the time, more than one would take. So the pregnancy rates were the multiple pregnancy rates. In that situation, they would have transferred eight and all eight took?
Starting point is 01:05:30
Yeah. I'm not saying it was the right thing to do, but that's what happened. One can split into two, but in that particular case, more than the recommended number were transferred. So now there are very strict guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, which is our professional organization, that almost always we're transferring just one embryo these days. Adam Blyth, MD, PhD Unless a couple says, I'd actually like to
Starting point is 01:05:51
have twins. Dr. Julie Kinn, MD, PhD We kind of discourage that. Adam Blyth, MD, PhD Why? Dr. Julie Kinn, MD, PhD Because twins are riskier. They're riskier for the babies and for the mom. Adam Blyth, MD, PhD Riskier in an IVF setting? Dr. Julie Kinn, MD, PhD No, they're just riskier in general. Adam Blyth, MD, PhD Are IVF twins, do they pose any more risk to either fetus or mom than naturally conceived
Starting point is 01:06:08
twins? Yes. There is some data that would suggest that IVF pregnancies are more complicated, have a higher risk of complication than spontaneous pregnancies. We don't know exactly why if it's the IVF or the fact that people who need IVF have underlying conditions that may predispose them to some of these complications. Overwhelmingly, the data's reassuring that pregnancies do fine, the babies do fine,
Starting point is 01:06:30
but we definitely know that twins, whether you're conceived them spontaneously or with IVF, the risk of almost every pregnancy complication is gonna be higher. So this is the risk of preeclampsia, help syndrome, blood clot, like anything that is a risk. Hypertension, hemorrhage, yes. Need for a C-section, all those risks.
Starting point is 01:06:50
Premature delivery, all those risks are increased. So we don't intentionally like to produce twins, although it happens sometimes, obviously. Okay. Boy, this is fascinating stuff. So I'm just trying to take this in some sort of thoughtful order. Should we now move to IVF, or do you
Starting point is 01:07:07
want to say a little bit more about IUI? We haven't really talked directly about IUI. By the way, I don't know what it is about when people say turkey baster. It makes me cringe like that. It's just such a gross image to me. So I am deliberately not going to say it, other than that moment ago that I just said it.
Starting point is 01:07:23
But just so that people know what we mean by intrauterine insemination, just to be clear, you are not using a turkey baster. Definitely not. Okay. Thank God. Most disgusting image. I don't know why I get so grossed out by that. So can you explain how IUI is done?
Starting point is 01:07:39
We've already said that with IUI, you largely favor an oral preparation. Usually, yeah. Yeah. Okay. He said that with IUI, you largely favor an oral preparation. Usually, yeah. Yeah. OK. That means you're using an oral set of hormones so that the woman doesn't have a massive proliferation of follicles.
Starting point is 01:07:55
So the male ejaculates. Do you want fresh semen, or do you care if it's frozen? What's the difference in success? Same. We have single women as well and female same-sex couples who would also be doing donor insemination in that case. And we don't see any difference between fresh semen
Starting point is 01:08:13
and frozen semen. No, assuming the sperm is normal. Assuming the sperm is ideal. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So the indications for IUI would be those scenarios I mentioned, single women, same-sex couples, or if there's a couple with unexplained infertility, you just can't find a reason, so you just want to try and
Starting point is 01:08:29
optimize their chances, or if there's a male factor, right, so if there's lower sperm count or lower motility, the idea with IUI is that the female partner would typically take fertility medication to increase the number of eggs. She would track her ovulation. When she's ovulating, she would come to the clinic. The male partner would come to the clinic, produce the sperm sample. We process the sperm, which is basically collect the best sperm in a small volume and then place that sperm directly into the uterus through the cervix. 06.
Starting point is 01:09:01
The problem that you're able to overcome on the sperm side would be number and motility. Yeah, or morphology, like any abnormality in the semen analysis as long as it's not very severe. It's not chromosomal. So if the sperm are too few, they don't move well enough. If they're defective in most ways. IVF, more specifically ICSI, which stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection, where we actually take a sperm and inject it directly into an egg.
Starting point is 01:09:30
So for severe male factor, that would be the recommended treatment. But if the sperm's a little bit low, but it's not too bad, then IUI, we would try a few cycles of that first. Dr. Ketchum Okay. So when in the woman's cycle, how many days before she ovulates do you want to inject those sperm into the mouth of the uterus? Essentially the day she's ovulating. So this is interesting to me because one of the things that I took away from the discussion
Starting point is 01:09:57
with Paul last week was that if you look at the probability distribution curve of when a pregnancy occurs, the ejaculate enters the uterus prior to ovulation. You have a, I forget what he said, 80% of pregnancies occur when the sperm are there prior to ovulation. And I could be wrong on this, I've already forgotten. I think only 20% occur post-ovulation. So the tail falls off much quicker. Yes.
Starting point is 01:10:25
It is true that if there's sperm around prior to ovulation, it can hang around for a while because it lives two to three days or so, whereas the lifespan of the ovulated egg is much shorter. It's much shorter. So based on that, wouldn't it make sense to put the sperm in prior to ovulation, or is it just too risky to try and anticipate when that is? If it's a stray couple, we'll tell them to also have intercourse every couple of days around the time of ovulation.
Starting point is 01:10:52
But the pregnancy rates in these probably back early studies that have looked at this show that probably the highest pregnancy rate if you do the insemination on the day that you think the patient is ovulating. And are you doing that with ultrasound? Usually LH monitoring, so patient will either monitor her urine, LH, and remember LH goes up just before ovulation. We typically also do ultrasound based on the size
Starting point is 01:11:17
of the follicles. We sometimes trigger ovulation with HCG, which kind of simulates the woman's own LH ser. So if you want to be pretty precise. How big a dose of HCG do you need? Usually 5,000 units, which is- Half a vial. It's a lot, probably more than physiologic. The purpose is to cause release of the egg, and then we time the insemination to happen when we think the ovulation is happening. Okay. Do you ever do the following? This is me just thinking out the box. Get the male
Starting point is 01:11:48
to bank a ton of sperm. Take weeks to get, or if she's going to a sperm bank, if it's a same sex couple, but whatever. Just get multiple aliquots of semen. So on day one, insert. Day two, insert. Day three, give 10,000 IU of HCG, insert. And then day four, insert. In other words, cover your bases and just have lots of semen sitting around and then force the ovulation. AMT. SIEGEL You could do that or the couple could just have sex. JS. But we then introduce another variable, right? Which is what if the semen... What if the count is low enough? Because if he's ejaculating every day,
Starting point is 01:12:26
you're not having a chance to fully rebuild the supply. What if his motility is anything other than perfect? Or in the other case, what if we're dealing with same-sex couples or a single mom? Yeah, there have been studies looking at two IUIs compared to one, specifically same-sex couples or single women, show no difference.
Starting point is 01:12:44
And remember, if you're paying out of pocket for all of these things, it has to be worth it. So at some point, even if what I proposed worked better, it's going to approach the cost of IVF. Right. How much better and is it worth another $400? Five days now, your cost of your IUI cycles all of a sudden, $2,000. Yeah, so those are practical considerations as well.
Starting point is 01:13:07
So maybe this question is too broad, so feel free to partition it. But if you look at all uses of IUI, what is the success rate? And feel free to, again, divide that up into different cases. The pregnancy success rate really depends on the age of the female partner. So if it's a young woman in her 20s, success rate might approach success rate for natural conception which might be 20 to 25% per cycle.
Starting point is 01:13:34
If it's a woman over 35, might be 10 to 15%. If it's a woman over 40, might only be 1 to 5% per cycle. Wow. And that's because, again, it's all about the quality of the egg. So even though an egg is released, maybe two eggs are released. If those eggs aren't normal, they're not going to fertilize an implant. Okay. So we've covered a whole lot of fertility treatments.
Starting point is 01:13:59
It seems that the likelihood that a woman who's undergone some of the things we've discussed that still ends up going down to the IVF pathway is reasonably high. Yeah, the majority of people don't need IVF. Again, it depends on the age of the female partner specifically and what the problem is. So let's just go sub 35. Okay. So of all women who present with defined infertility, which if she's under 35 means more than a
Starting point is 01:14:25
year of regular sex, no pregnancy, walk through the success rate of pregnancy by modality. So under 35, infertility for a year, how many are successful with just an oral treatment absent IUI? Again, it sort of depends on what the cause of the infertility is. Is it unexplained or is it PCOS? No, let's say unexplained. Unexplained, probably less than 50% will get pregnant with IUI and have to move on to IVF because unexplained to me means either it's bad luck or more likely if something's going on we just can't figure it out. In those cases, almost always IVF is going to give you a higher chance of success.
Starting point is 01:15:06
Oh, sorry. Yes. That I can understand for sure. I'm saying how many of them will need to get IVF? Are you answering that question as well? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I was getting at.
Starting point is 01:15:16
For PCOS, their problem was they just weren't ovulating. So probably 80% of those people will get pregnant with just ovulation induction and IUI because you're solving the problem. So hormonal therapy basically is addressing the problem. Got it. If it's very severe male factor, probably IUI is not going to work. So it really kind of depends what the etiology of the infertility. And so now if we talk about, oh, age 35 to 45.
Starting point is 01:15:39
And again, let's take PCOS off the table in this age group. So let's just say we're talking 35 to 45 year old womenold women, PCOS not an issue, and let's just also assert male not an issue. That's been worked out. Unexplained infertility. So I guess now technically you would call it six months of not getting pregnant would be sufficient, but what percentage of women will get pregnant absent an IVF strategy? So depends how long you do it for.
Starting point is 01:16:04
So most of the time we're only doing it for three cycles because, like I said, it's not cost effective to do it for longer. So, I would say, in that age group, probably the majority of women will likely need IVF if they are not successful after three months. Theoretically, if you continue doing IUI, a lot of those people will eventually get pregnant. But we tend to stop at three months. Theoretically, if you continue doing IUI, a lot of those people will eventually get pregnant.
Starting point is 01:16:26
But we tend to stop at three months. Tell me at three months again what percentage are going to be successful with three cycles. In that age group of unexplained infertility. Unexplained over 35. I don't know the exact number, but probably under 50%. Okay. But that could be a third potentially. Yeah. Yeah. Because the success rate per cycle is something like in that age group, let's say 10 to 15%. So it's-
Starting point is 01:16:49
So you go one minus that number times three, one minus that to the third power, should be about 30%. Exactly. Okay, so now let's talk a little bit about IVF. First successful IVF baby, 1978, if my memory serves correctly. That's right.
Starting point is 01:17:04
Referred to as a test tube baby, which is kind of weird, because I would imagine it was in a Petri dish, not a test tube. But anyway. Yeah. Yeah. We've come a long way since then. For historical context, I don't know anything about that girl. But do you know anything about how that was done back in 1978?
Starting point is 01:17:20
Yeah. Actually, there's a recent docudrama out called Joy. Is that her name? Her middle name I believe is Joy. Ah. Yes. Well that's great. Louise Joy Brown.
Starting point is 01:17:31
What's her name? Louise Brown. Louise Brown. I believe her middle name is Joy. Got it. It's a movie about the first IVF success. Oh, that's great. Now of course, they tried for many, many years before they had the first success.
Starting point is 01:17:42
These were two doctors. I mean, maybe this is all in the docudrama and I can't wait to check it out, but what kind of IRB approval was there? How much controversy was there around this? It must have been a huge deal. Yeah, there was a lot of controversy. Like, this was very freaky.
Starting point is 01:17:55
You're playing God. Yeah, yeah. And this was done at the time, primarily for women with tubal factor block tubes. I think, can't remember the exact details of the couple, but I believe they had tubal disease. and IVF works great for tubal disease because of course you're bypassing the tubes altogether. Where was this done?
Starting point is 01:18:12
In the UK and Britain. I didn't realize it wasn't done here in the US. So tell me a little bit about technologically how they accomplished it back then. Yeah, I think the first cases they were actually doing surgery under general anesthesia. Open surgery to heartless? Or leproscopic, I think the first cases, they were actually doing surgery under general anesthesia. Open surgery to harvest. Or leproscopic, I believe. Yeah. To retrieve the eggs.
Starting point is 01:18:30
Oh, wow. And then they were combining the eggs with the sperm in the test tube, Petri dish. And then I think they were transferring the embryo maybe back into the tube in those days, or maybe through the cervix. I can't remember the details. But yes, a lot has changed over the last 45 years or so. Wow. Despite that success in 1978, what did it look like for the next 10 years?
Starting point is 01:18:58
From 1978 to 1988, how prevalent was IVF? I guess when did it get to the point where anybody who could afford it could access it? Much more recently. Yeah, the first IVF baby in the United States was born a few years later, I think maybe 1981 or so, in Virginia, I believe. It took probably many decades for it to become commonplace throughout the world.
Starting point is 01:19:20
So now most countries, you can access IVF. Not everybody can access IVF, but in some countries, more than others. But depending most countries you can access IVF. Not everybody can access IVF but in some countries more than others. But depending on how you look at it, it's kind of new, kind of not, 45 years. But in medicine that's relatively recent development and it's been only in the last maybe 20, 30 years that it's become standard. Okay. So let's just walk through how IVF works and then we'll kind of dive into the ins and outs of some of the nuances. So a woman comes to you, so let's just walk through how IVF works and then we'll kind of dive into the ins and outs of some of the nuances. So a woman comes to you, probably she's progressed through some layers of treatment, but you've
Starting point is 01:19:51
collectively come to the decision that this is hands down the best opportunity both for success and risk. So how does the treatment go? So typically we do a bunch of screening tests on both partners. That includes some blood tests, semen analysis, an ultrasound to get some assessment of their egg number, the woman's egg number. And then when the cycle starts, it takes about two to three months to complete a cycle of IVF.
Starting point is 01:20:16
And when you say egg number, are you determining that through an AMH or through a physical examination of the ovaries? Both. So we do an ultrasound. We can count the number of follicles. How small are these things? A few millimeters. And you have the resolution to see that on an ultrasound? Yeah.
Starting point is 01:20:33
And that gives you some sense of about how many eggs that particular patient will produce with ovarian stimulation. And we use AMH as a hormone you mentioned. Explain what AMH is and how it works. Yeah, AMH is a hormone that stands for anti-malarion hormone. It's secreted by the cells that surround the egg, so it tends to correlate with egg number.
Starting point is 01:20:52
Doesn't tell you anything about fertility or pregnancy rates or anything like that. Age is still the most important factor in that sense, but it does give you an idea. Do you have a normal number of eggs for your age? Just numbers. So two women that have the same number of eggs, if one woman has high quality eggs, the other woman does not, they could still have the same AMH level on a blood test.
Starting point is 01:21:13
Right. If they're different ages, their success rates can be different. Remind me the range. So a prepubescent girl who has a billion, not a billion, but right, a million eggs, but who is not fertile, does she have a higher low AMH? She has a billion, not a billion, but right, a million eggs, but who is not fertile. Does she have a higher low AMH? She has a higher AMH. We tend not to use it in that age group
Starting point is 01:21:29
because it's less reliable, but a normal AMH would be about two, I think the unit's pick around per deciliter, I believe. Less than one is considered low. So a woman who's older. But what's the difference between a 16-year-old girl who probably could get pregnant if she walked past a guy versus... That never happens, by the way.
Starting point is 01:21:50
Oh, okay, good. No, but if you have like a 16-year-old girl who is at the peak of her fertility versus a 30-year-old woman who is still fertile but has lost a step, like what's the difference in AMH? Yeah, it's a very narrow range. So like above two, we consider that's probably normal reproductive age. Above two is two, effectively.
Starting point is 01:22:07
Okay. Now, it can be high too, and patients with PCOS, for example, have very high levels, but different thing. But above two, that's usually good number of eggs, less than one, low number of eggs. So this is kind of a binary test. Well, not really. You're not looking at, oh, this woman's 1.6, this woman's 1.7, this woman's... Not that.
Starting point is 01:22:26
Yeah. You're not looking at it like you look at a TSH or something. Right, right. And the assay is also very variable, depends where you have it done, whatever. Just gives you a 90 DL. Is the egg number average for your person's age? More than average, less than average. And it helps us because we can determine what dose of medication to use during IVF,
Starting point is 01:22:42
and we also can give expectation to the patient, you're probably gonna make five to 10 eggs, maybe not 15 to 20, and that type of thing. When she's ready to start the cycle, everything usually starts with her period, depending on the age again, but usually the patient starts on a couple weeks of birth control pills, and what that does
Starting point is 01:23:01
is kind of suppresses the ovaries, because we want all the eggs to kind of grow at the same rate. Stop the pill, then you start the gonadotropins, which are the FSH. Now you go injectable. Yep, and they're injectable, just under the skin kind of injections.
Starting point is 01:23:12
So meaning HCG and FSH. Not HCG, but primarily FSH with a little bit of LH. So you're on those for about eight to 12 days. And then every few days, while you're taking those medications, you have to come into the clinic for ultrasound monitoring and estradiol levels, blood levels. And we can monitor how many follicles are growing,
Starting point is 01:23:35
how big they are, et cetera. Usually, medications are pretty well tolerated. And what dose of LH and FSH is she injecting relative to what she would normally make? Is it a 2x, 5x, 10x? It depends on the age again, higher doses for women who are older, but much, much higher doses. More than 10x? Maybe not. Maybe five.
Starting point is 01:23:56
Typical symptoms? Most common, I would say, is bloating as the ovaries get a little more enlarged. There's a small risk of something called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when the ovaries get a little bit too stimulated, but that's exceedingly rare. There's signs that it's happening, we can always back down on the dose. Sometimes the patient doesn't make as many eggs
Starting point is 01:24:15
as we were hoping, so sometimes we have to increase the dose or change the protocol, but usually we guess pretty right. And then once the follicles are a certain size, that's how we know the eggs are mature. Because of course we can't see the eggs on the ultrasound, you can only see the follicles that contain the egg. So then the patient gets HCG,
Starting point is 01:24:35
which is another medication which kind of simulates her own LH surge. And the purpose of that medication, it causes the final maturation of the eggs. And if we did not do an egg retrieval, she would release all those eggs. But of course, we time the egg retrieval to happen just before the woman ovulates.
Starting point is 01:24:53
So that medication is very time sensitive. And to be clear, were you only giving her FSH before or were you giving her LH as well? A little bit of LH, but mostly FSH. And why are you using LH versus HCG? Just to simulate the physiologic cycle. I didn't realize there was a difference appreciated by the body between them. They're very similar, so we use HCG for, but the body of course doesn't have HCG until
Starting point is 01:25:18
the patient's pregnant, but it works well as a substitute for LH. So there is synthetic LH out there as a drug? Yeah. Okay. It's combined with, comes in as a substitute for LH. So there is synthetic LH out there as a drug? Yeah. Okay. It's combined with, comes in as a combination drug. With the FSH? Yeah. Got it, I see.
Starting point is 01:25:31
So how do you prevent her from ovulating while you are giving her FSH and LH and she is ripening multiple follicles? Yes, good question, good question. How are you preventing an ovulation? There's another medication that we give. It's called the GnRH antagonist, and basically blocks the LH surge from happening
Starting point is 01:25:53
until we cause it. When you're giving her FSH, the LH that's attached to it is very, very low. Right. That will prevent an ovulation. Yes, the antagonist will. Basically blocking the GnRH, which is another hormone. I'm surprised that the fact that you're giving her so much FSH with a little bit of LH
Starting point is 01:26:11
isn't enough to suppress the GnRH. But anyway, clearly not, or you wouldn't be having to give her that. OK, so you give her a GnRH antagonist. That basically puts a block between her hypothalamus and her pituitary. Right. So then now you control the switch. And the switch is in the megados of HCG, which is an LH analog. Do you harvest the follicles in the fallopian tube?
Starting point is 01:26:34
In the ovaries. So the egg retrieval happens two days after that HCG trigger. Wow. Yeah. It would have taken two days? Thirty-six hours specifically. So she usually takes have taken two days. 36 hours, specifically. So she usually takes it in the evening, and then the retrieval.
Starting point is 01:26:49
The day after in the morning. OK, so a woman comes into your office two days later and walk me through this. So you lay her on a table. You've got an ultrasound on her ovary, and you're literally putting a needle in there? Well, first of all, she's asleep. Fully asleep or just local sedation?
Starting point is 01:27:04
Propofol. Yeah. So this is done in a surgery Well, first of all, she's asleep. Fully asleep or just local sedation? Propofol, yeah. Okay. So this is done in a surgery center typically or clinic with anesthesiologist present, IV sedation. It's like a colonoscopy or dental extraction or something. Yeah. All done vaginally actually using the ultrasound. And that day there's a needle that's guided by the ultrasound that goes through the vagina
Starting point is 01:27:24
into the ovaries. So we don't do trans-abdominal. Dumb question. Don't you have a much straighter shot going through the abdomen? No, really. You just don't want to go through the peritoneum. And there's a lot of stuff between the abdomen and the ovary, like bowel. And you can't just manipulate and move the bowel out of the way or something?
Starting point is 01:27:37
No, it's much easier through the vagina. They're sitting right there. So again, just pardon my ignorance of the anatomy because again, I'm probably still locked into the image of the ovaries being like this. But you're saying, no, Peter, the ovaries are probably sitting right on top of the uterus. Right on top of the top of the vagina to the side of the uterus. You just stick a needle on either side and you can get- So literally out of the vagina, not even going through the cervix.
Starting point is 01:27:59
That still strikes me as a very delicate, complicated procedure. I mean, it's a surgery. Yeah, relatively minor type surgery. How much do you have to dilate the vagina? What I'm thinking about is how to get your hand in there to guide the needle. You don't have to get your hand in there. Yeah, you should watch a YouTube video,
Starting point is 01:28:16
but it's just the ultrasound probe, and there's a needle guide. Is the needle guide inside the probe or alongside? Alongside. Okay. And the needle, it's a long needle, right? So or alongside? Alongside. Okay. And the needle, it's a long needle, right? So your hand's not in the vagina. What gauge?
Starting point is 01:28:29
16, and it goes through the vagina. You're doing this under ultrasound guidance. You can see exactly. But somebody else is obviously manipulating the ultrasound for you. No, no, you have it in your hand. It's a vaginal ultrasound. Oh, that's right, that's right.
Starting point is 01:28:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're doing both. So you're looking where you're going with the ultrasound and you're using the needle to puncture the ovary, get into the follicles. The needle is attached to like a vacuum suction. And so the fluid and the follicles collected goes through the needle into the test tube. And then that test tube is handed off to the embryologist. They look under the microscope and try and isolate the egg.
Starting point is 01:29:06
Now, I'm just so full of dumb questions here today, Paula. How do you prevent yourself from sucking out 300 non-folical eggs and ultimately destroy your long-term fertility risks? Well, you only go into the large follicles, which are really the only ones you can see on ultrasound. There's a gazillion of eggs in there, but you can't even see them. And you're not running the risk of sucking up those eggs? No.
Starting point is 01:29:33
No, you're just going into the follicles. How big is the ovary? The ovary is a few centimeters at that point, but each follicle is about two centimeters, I would say, and there might be ten. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How is each follicle two centimeters? In diameter. But you said the ovary is only a couple of centimeters.
Starting point is 01:29:48
No, it's like maybe five, six, like a small plum or something. Okay, wait a minute. So if you have a plum or a tangerine that is the ovary, you're saying each follicle is two centimeters in diameter? Roughly. That's huge. 1.5 to two.
Starting point is 01:30:04
I wouldn't have even thought it was one centimeter. How many follicles are in diameter? Roughly. That's huge. 1.5 to 2. I wouldn't have even thought it was 1 centimeter. How many follicles are in there? On average, we get 10 to 15. So maybe the ovary is bigger. Maybe it's more like an orange. I'm thinking more an unstimulated ovary is more like a plum. When it's stimulated, more like a grapefruit.
Starting point is 01:30:19
OK, I see. So you have really good resolution of where the follicles are. Yeah. OK, so you're not running the risk of sucking everything out of the ov follicles are. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so you're not running the risk of sucking everything out of the ovary. No. And we're just getting fluid, right?
Starting point is 01:30:30
We're not touching tissue of the ovary, just the fluid and the follicles. It's only a 16 gauge needle. Does that mean you're puncturing the follicle? Each follicle, yeah. Gets punctured before it enters the needle. Yeah. The fluid, yeah. So you do before it enters the needle. Yeah. The fluid, yeah. So you do it one at a time.
Starting point is 01:30:47
You go, ping, into a follicle, burst it open, and the egg, because a 16 gauge needle is probably only a millimeter across. Yeah. You suck out all the fluid, and you don't have to take it out each time. You can go from follicle to follicle to follicle. You just have to go in typically twice. once on the right and once on the left. Pretty interesting that that works. Yeah. It's easiest maybe to just watch a video of it and then you get the idea.
Starting point is 01:31:12
I'm just thinking of all the things that could go wrong and how the needle could get gunked up with tissue and then you got to pull it out and put it back in. All those things can happen. There's always a small risk of bleeding, small risk of infection, small risk of injury in other organs. And this is happening, you do this on both sides because presumably you're stimulating both sides. Yep. So how long does that procedure typically take?
Starting point is 01:31:33
Half an hour. And you've got the embryologist next to you and he or she is under the microscope going check, check, check, check, check. He or she is validating that you indeed are getting ripened eggs. And they look different, presumably. Those are easy to identify under a light microscope. Basically, it tells they got eggs.
Starting point is 01:31:53
We don't know if they're mature, yet we know nothing about them yet. I see. But when we get the eggs, they go to the lab, and then the rest of the process happens there. So the retrieval, we're just aspirating all the follicles, trying to get as many eggs as possible. OK.
Starting point is 01:32:08
Then let's just assume that the woman is doing this not to just freeze her eggs, but because she wants to get pregnant. Would you then go ahead and, when she wakes up, have a discussion that says, we got this many eggs, how many would you like to fertilize? How many would you like to freeze? That discussion has happened way upstream.
Starting point is 01:32:28
Typically, we're fertilizing all of them. Yeah, there's no reason not to fertilize. Okay, tell me the time course now and how you move from retrieval to fertilization. So then the eggs are sitting in the Petri dish in the lab. What's the medium? It is this proprietary medium. It's proprietary? Yes. Meaning each lab will What's the medium? It is this proprietary medium. Is proprietary?
Starting point is 01:32:45
Yes. Meaning each lab will have its own medium? There are commercial companies that make it, but the exact components of it, not entirely known. So there are different companies that have different mediums? Yes, I believe there's more than one, but it's meant to kind of emulate the fluid in the tubes like where fertilization would normally happen. How much of a competitive advantage
Starting point is 01:33:08
is it for an embryologist? Like, how many options do they have to choose from, commercially? Of media? I don't think there are that many media companies. I see. Is this a huge area of innovation in the field? It must be.
Starting point is 01:33:21
Not really. I would have guessed this would be so important. I think they got it down. Was there a day when this was a problem? I'm sure. OK. Yeah, maybe in the field, it must be. Not really. I would have guessed this would be so important. I think they got it down. Was there a day when this was a problem? I'm sure. Yeah, maybe in the early days. So the embryologist transfers this to the media. Yep.
Starting point is 01:33:32
A few hours later, the eggs are inseminated. So with conventional IVF, we just put a bunch of sperm in there and let the fertilization happen by itself. With ICSI, or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the embryologist takes a single sperm and injects it into each egg. And the only time again you need to do ICSI is if the sperm is so dysfunctional
Starting point is 01:33:55
that it can't even on its own with no barriers make its way to fertilization when placed in direct proximity of an egg? It probably could, but maybe there's too few sperms. So anytime there's a male factor, we tend to do ICSI. Any male factor you just rate to ICSI? Yeah. And in fact, a lot of times it's done
Starting point is 01:34:13
even when there isn't a male factor because fertilization rate is a little bit higher with ICSI compared to IVF. In very few cases, you don't get fertilization so you don't wanna find out, oh, by the way, sperm can't fertilize your egg. That's the whole problem all along because then you got to throw away the eggs. So, again, for a couple listening to us now,
Starting point is 01:34:33
this is something they need to be talking about with their fertility doc, which is, hey, do you do Ixie out of the gate no matter what? Yeah, it's a little controversial because it adds cost. How much cost? Probably another $1,000 or $2,000 or what. Yeah, it's a little controversial because it adds cost. How much cost? Probably another $1,000 or $2,000 or something. No, probably $1,000. So, the data, to be clear, shows that ICSE and IVF have similar success rates for non-male factor.
Starting point is 01:34:57
But I'm just telling you that a lot of times we're doing it anyway because we don't want to find out small, very small percentage of cases that have zero fertilization. That's like not a good conversation. Yeah. Oh, that would be just catastrophic because you've lost those eggs too. Right. Right.
Starting point is 01:35:13
Oh, God. So that's part of the reason that we do it. But technically, if you just look at the data, success rates should be the same exceeding conventional IVF if non-male factor. But a lot of times there's sperm factor, so we're doing XC anyway. These go into the media sits at room temperature, I'm sorry, at body temperature. Do you put it into a 37 degree oven? Yeah, body temperature in an incubator and then all the micro-manipulations happening.
Starting point is 01:35:38
What are the types of manipulations that are needed to foster the right environment? How much you're moving the fluid around, how often you're changing the media. This is like the most important cell culture experiment of all time. Pretty much, pretty much. To be fair, it's done by the embryologists, not by me, but they strip the eggs first, which means they remove the cells around the eggs.
Starting point is 01:35:57
Then a few hours later, they're injecting the sperm into each egg. And then the media these days may or may not get changed over the five or six days that we culture the embryos, trying to not have to take the embryos out of the incubator if we don't have to kind of thing. So by the next day, usually we look at the embryos to see, or the eggs to see if they're fertilized.
Starting point is 01:36:23
Usually about 70% of the eggs fertilize. So let's say we get 10 eggs. You can expect maybe seven of them will be fertilized and now there's seven embryos. So we discard the unfertilized eggs, continue to culture. And you can tell that grossly or are you having to move them under a microscope? Under a microscope, yeah.
Starting point is 01:36:42
And then we culture them in the Petri dish. At this point, are they all in one dish or are you separating them? They're in one droplet of oil and there might be more than one droplet in each dish. How are embryologists trained? How does one become an embryologist? Well there's no clear pathway. There's not a whole bunch of embryology schools. But if I wanted to be an embryologist, Well, there's no clear pathway. There's not a whole bunch of embryology schools. But if I wanted to be an embryologist, what would I do?
Starting point is 01:37:08
Mostly, I've got an apprenticeship almost. You might start working in a fertility clinic and do some basic lab prep work initially. Most of them have some sort of undergraduate science background, but you don't have to. But anyway, you gain experience in the lab and then eventually you become a junior embryologist. So it's like a mentorship program. How many years would it take if I started tomorrow working as a lab tech who was doing nothing but cleaning Petri dishes? How many years would it take for me to be the head embryologist in your lab?
Starting point is 01:37:39
It might take four to five years. Take a while. Now there's some formal schools available as well with online programs, with some in-person components. Not to take anything away from what you do, but you could have the best fertility doctor. If they don't have a good embryologist, you're not gonna have great success rates. Oh yeah, yeah. I would say the lab is almost more important
Starting point is 01:38:02
than what we do, because there's just more variability. But luckily, the United States labs are pretty good. But yeah, that's one of the most important things. I mean, because I used to work in a lab, I just think I just can think of a hundred ways that could get screwed up. Contaminated, jostled, all these things that can go wrong. Super important. Yeah. So most of the success rate, probably more related to what happens in the lab than anything I do or one of my physician colleagues does.
Starting point is 01:38:31
I guess the question is, well, let's finish the story and then I wanna come back. So how many days, you go to 14 days of this? No, five days, six days, and depending if we're doing a fresh transfer or freezing the embryos or a fresh transfer, we sometimes- So you'll do both, right? We do both. Yeah. Although these days, most of the time, we're freezing.
Starting point is 01:38:51
Because you're doing genetic screening? Because we're doing genetic testing, right? Okay. So let's go through that example then. So we're culturing these embryos in the Petri dish for five to six days. Then we look at them again, the ones that have made it to that stage, which is usually only half of them. So remember, you're seven, now maybe there's three or four.
Starting point is 01:39:08
So what explains that? So most likely the ones that didn't make it are the chromosomally abnormal ones. Remember, we talked earlier about those ones not making it. And the reason it's only half is because by definition, you're doing this in women who tend to be a bit older. Not that one would do this, but just as a thought experiment, if you did this exact thing in 18-year-old girls, presumably you'd have a much higher success rate. Yeah. We call that the blastulation rate is a little bit higher in younger women.
Starting point is 01:39:38
Also, you have more eggs and more embryos, of course. But yes, the blastulation rate, the ones that make it to day five or six is a lower percentage, the older a woman is because a higher proportion of those embryos are just going to be abnormal. So the ones that make it to day five or six are more likely to be normal, but not necessarily normal. So we can also do genetic testing on those embryos, which involves biopsying them. So we take a few cells from the embryo, freeze the embryos. So yeah, let's talk about that. So how many cells do you have at five days again?
Starting point is 01:40:11
Altogether you might have like 60 to 80 cells. OK, so you take two or three of those. Five or six. Five or six. Yeah. And they're from the trophoblast. The perimeter. Not the embryo directly, but the cells surrounding the embryo.
Starting point is 01:40:24
You still have full genetic material there. Yeah. And so you do that for each and every egg, every embryo, sorry, and then you freeze each embryo? Yeah. Tell me what the freezing process is like. So the freezing process these days is one called vitrification, it's called, and it's like this special kind of freezing that doesn't result in ice crystals.
Starting point is 01:40:44
So how do you do that? There's a process that happens in the lab. There's a machine that does it that lowers the temperature. So the rate at which they lower the temperature? Right, it's rapid. Okay, so it's like a liquid nitrogen dump basically. Right, as opposed to old days when we did slow freezing. So it becomes like a glass-like state without crystals.
Starting point is 01:41:04
It works really well and the survival is really high. And then you store them at what temp? Like liquid nitrogen temp? Yeah. It's not like in your freezer? No. At home. And then how long does it take typically to get the genetic results?
Starting point is 01:41:15
Typically within a week or two. Okay. What depth of genetic testing is being done here? Are you doing whole genome sequence or are you just looking at a handful of SNPs that are pre-identified as the ones that matter? So, it's evolved over time and I should say it's still very controversial because there's always a risk of harming the embryos. You're only looking at a few cells. So, is it really representative of the embryo? I mean, we do it a lot, and the data definitely shows
Starting point is 01:41:45
that if you transfer a normal embryo, it has a very high chance of implanting, but the issue recently has been, are we discarding embryos that are maybe normal, because we think they're abnormal based on the genetic testing, but the genetic testing is flawed. Presumably, genetic testing is really easy
Starting point is 01:42:02
to identify aneuploidy. The chromosomal analysis is trivial. Yes, it's geared up to do that, right. Generally genetic testing is really easy to identify aneuploidy. Chromosomal analysis is trivial. Yes, it's geared up to do that, right. So most of the time we're using something called next generation sequencing, which is very high level sequencing, but it's not whole genome sequencing. So you're getting- Targeted.
Starting point is 01:42:17
Yeah. And you're looking mostly at chromosomal abnormalities, unless you know that the couple is a carrier for some genetic mutation that you also want to screen for. Yeah, so let's say one of the parents, well, this would be a bad example, but. Cystic fibrosis, like let's say both patients are carriers. So both of them are a carrier for CF, and so there's a one in four chance
Starting point is 01:42:40
that you're gonna get two copies of the CF. So then you're looking directly for the CF genes. Exactly, exactly. Okay, beta-thal, sickle cell, the standard. Yeah, there's a whole bunch of them, right. And part of the screening, we didn't mention it, but most people doing IVF will get carrier screening to see if they're carriers for any genetic mutations.
Starting point is 01:42:57
But that's a pretty common scenario where you have two people that are CF carriers, neither of whom have CF. Most of those people would say, I'm going to do IVF because I don't want to take the chance. And then what about people who come in and say, oh, but one of us is each an APOE4 carrier, so we're each a 3-4 and we would really like to not select a 4-4 as an example. So one, are you able to look at that? And two, does that start to cross an ethical line?
Starting point is 01:43:23
Yeah, it's a little more controversial when you're talking about- Non-deterministic adult consequence genes. With variable penetrance, right? You may or may not get Alzheimer's or whatever it is. So it's a little more controversial, but we're kind of going in that direction, I would say. We're definitely going probably in the near future towards whole genome sequencing
Starting point is 01:43:43
where we can pick up even mutations that happen. De novo, what we call de novo, right? You might not be a carrier, but it might just happen randomly. So you could pick up some disease that way. And then what you're talking about is- Like BRCA. Well, BRCA, yeah.
Starting point is 01:43:58
Often we know ahead of time, your patient's carrier, we can test for it. LPA for cardiovascular disease. Yeah, there's a whole bunch of things. So people are starting to talk about polygenic screening of embryos, but it's a little more controversial because the science isn't quite settled yet. And it's one thing if you're already doing IVF and we have these embryos here and we're just going to add another layer of testing like which one of these embryos is at higher
Starting point is 01:44:23
risk for like diabetes or hypertension. Whole different story if you're saying, oh, you should do IVF because we want to get the embryo with the lowest risk of these diseases. So we're not quite there. This is very controversial. Plus, it's expensive and we already talked about cost barriers and there are ethical issues as well.
Starting point is 01:44:42
Are we now, is it a form of positive eugenics and that type of thing? So that particular type of testing is still controversial, but aneuploid testing, testing for chromosomal abnormalities is pretty routine, pretty standard. Now there was a day when people weren't doing any genetic testing.
Starting point is 01:45:00
And the embryo selection was just based on morphology, right? Yes, yes, yeah. Which is back in the days where we had to transfer more than one embryo because we didn't know. You could look at two embryos and they could look both normal, but one of them is chromosomally abnormal and one's not, and you can't really tell. So we had to transfer more embryos to get decent pregnancy rates now with genetic testing because we know that a chromosomally normal embryo has a pretty high chance of implanting,
Starting point is 01:45:28
not 100%, like maybe 70, 75%. So there's still reasons, for some reason, that's not the whole story, because even chromosomally normal embryos sometimes don't implant. Yeah, that's lower than I would have guessed. Is it? 70 to 75% for something that's chromosomally normal.
Starting point is 01:45:44
I would have guessed at that stage, given all the selections taking place. What is the concordance between, let's go one step further, chromosomally genetically normal and good morphology? There's good correlation. Yeah. We use both. If there's discordance there, which one are you relying on or are you discarding unless you have concordance that's positive for both?
Starting point is 01:46:07
In reality, the ones that have poor morphology aren't even frozen or biopsied, they're discarded because we know... So we select it out. Yeah, you're selected out. So there might be a little bit of difference in morphology between the ones that you've actually decided to freeze and biopsy and keep, and you presumably have the genetic testing on all of them. Do would preferentially of course transfer the ones
Starting point is 01:46:28
that are chromosomally normal, even if the morphology grade is a little bit lower. So you have selected out bad morphology. Let's just say you harvested 15, you fertilized 10, seven had good morphology, six came back genetically good. Those would be reasonable numbers? Maybe 5.
Starting point is 01:46:49
Yeah, the 6 out of 7 is high. Yeah. So 5 came back genetically good. Let's say in a young person. Yeah. So you've got one third of what you harvested you could implant. You're saying each of those is 70 to 75% success rate, and yet you would only implant one at a time.
Starting point is 01:47:06
Yeah. Which is interesting, because if you implanted two, let's do the math, you're talking about... 50% chance, roughly, of twins. That's right, I was just going to say. Yeah, which is high. Too high. We just can't take that risk. I mean, obviously, we believe in patient autonomy.
Starting point is 01:47:22
Patient usually gets to make that decision, but... You're going to make the case for where that's not a great idea. You want a healthy baby in the end, you want a healthy mom. Yeah, okay, so now let's talk about, now it's time to implant. So how does that process work? So that process is much less complicated,
Starting point is 01:47:37
but equally important. So usually it's timed. It has to happen at a certain time in the cycle. So we either use the woman's natural cycle to time it and time it at the time that implantation would normally occur, which is the second half of the cycle, or we use what we call a controlled program cycle where we basically give the woman the hormones and then time the transfer to happen at a specific time. The actual process, kind of like a pap smear.
Starting point is 01:48:02
It basically doesn't require any anesthesia or anything. We do do it under ultrasound guidance, so abdominal ultrasound. We thaw one of the embryos, draw it up in a little catheter with a little syringe on the end, place the speculum in the vagina, and then just pass the catheter through the cervix, and we're looking on the ultrasound for the placement.
Starting point is 01:48:22
And where are you implanting it? One and a half centimeters to 2 centimeters from the top of the uterus. So a few centimeters through the cervix. How do you make sure it doesn't come out? I mean, you can't, but it doesn't. Usually, you put it in there, I describe it more like peanut butter in there.
Starting point is 01:48:39
It's not like you can stand up and it comes out. What's the total volume you're injecting? 50 microliters, really small. What does the total volume you're injecting? 50 microliters. Really small. What does the inside of a uterus look like at that stage? You've timed it so that this is a uterus that doesn't have a lining yet. It does have a lining.
Starting point is 01:48:55
How thick is the lining? It's about 7 to 10 millimeters. But it's going to get a heck of a lot thicker. This is technically only about 14 days past her period, or are you doing it artificially more into the luteal phase? So it's roughly seven days or so after ovulation, right? Ah, got it, yes, yes, yes. So the lining has thickened already.
Starting point is 01:49:17
And that's one of the things we check with ultrasound before we do the transfer to make sure the lining is... What does that actually look like? Is it tentacle fingers or...? On the ultrasound, which is how we assess it, basically the two walls of the uterus are opposing each other. It's not like you can see the cavity. It's a potential space, not a real space.
Starting point is 01:49:37
Potential space, exactly. On the ultrasound, the lining has a different echo density than the muscle. The wall itself, right. Right. lining has a different echo density than the muscle. The wall itself, right. Right, so we can measure the thickness. And basically, the combined thickness of the two posing walls has to be at least seven millimeters or so. And if you get in there and do the ultrasound and it's not,
Starting point is 01:49:56
are you gonna come back and try to do it another day? And have you lost that egg because it's been thawed? Or can you keep that egg in the medium now? We essentially assess the lining a week before we do the transfer. So we would not thaw the embryo unless we were sure the lining. Until it's go time.
Starting point is 01:50:12
Yeah. Because once it's thawed, I mean, you can refreeze it, but probably doesn't do as well. Not a good idea. Yeah. OK. So I see. So once you put that egg in there.
Starting point is 01:50:20
Embryo. I'm sorry, that embryo in there closer to the top of the uterus. It's largely being held in place by the opposition of the wall. And then are you done or are you still doing ongoing hormone therapy? Sometimes we give supplemental progesterone. That's another hormone that helps maintain the pregnancy. And then usually 12 to 14 days later, the patient has her first pregnancy test.
Starting point is 01:50:41
Hopefully she's pregnant. We usually follow the pregnancy for the first few weeks. And then she transfers to her non IVF. OB or midway, yeah. Wow. It's just kind of amazing that this all works. Yeah. I've been doing it for 30 plus years,
Starting point is 01:50:54
and I still find it fascinating. Yeah. OK, so how often does a woman go through all of this, and for whatever reason, you can't get enough eggs or the eggs you get are not chromosomally normal and her next alternative is an egg donor. Unfortunately more often than we would like, again it depends on the age of the patient but sometimes patients do multiple cycles, maybe they don't have any normal embryos or maybe even the normal embryos
Starting point is 01:51:25
we transfer don't take or a number of different things can happen. So the most common reason someone would need an egg donor is usually maternal age, so someone who's older and has tried to get pregnant with their own eggs hasn't worked for whatever reason and then now she's looking at egg donation as an option. That works really well. So usually egg donors are young women in their 20s, early 30s sometimes. They produce multiple eggs.
Starting point is 01:51:53
And then the age of the uterus doesn't seem to matter as much. So the success rate with donor egg is quite high. It's about 70, 75%. Whereas for women over 40, using their own eggs, success rate might be 10 to 20 percent. Per cycle. Per cycle.
Starting point is 01:52:11
Yeah. Wow. 10 to 20 percent for a 40-year-old woman. Yeah. Untested embryos. Or they may not get any embryos. Normal embryos. Yeah. I did not realize it was that low. Yeah. How many times can a young woman be an egg donor before you worry about, is there anything
Starting point is 01:52:29
you worry about if you're counseling these women? I assume the same women are coming to you as egg donors. Yes. Sometimes people do it multiple times. Sometimes they just do it once. Does it pose any risk? They're essentially undergoing the IVF process themselves or at least the first half of it. There's the risk we talk about ovarian hyperstimulation,
Starting point is 01:52:46
which is rare, risks associated with the retrieval, anesthesia. But is there anything that restricts her ability to get pregnant later in life? No. Barring any complications from major complications, it does not seem to impact future fertility. What is the typical fee that's collected by an egg donor?
Starting point is 01:53:04
It's usually between $5,000 and $ and ten thousand dollars depending on where you live. Okay. That's a lot of money. It's a lot of money for two week period. I mean there's real incentive to do that. Yeah. And so a woman could do that a couple times a year if she wanted to? So the guidelines up to six times.
Starting point is 01:53:19
Six times a year? No. Six times lifetime. Oh. Okay. So up to six times. And that's a little bit arbitrary, but the professional society has decided that's kind of a good number of times.
Starting point is 01:53:32
Most people don't do it that many times. They might just do it once or twice. And so what is, and maybe you don't do this, I don't know, but women who undergo egg donation or IVFV egg donation, what do you discuss with them about the appropriateness of timing in explaining to the children that they have a different genetic mother? Before anybody does egg donation or even before they donate eggs, we always have them meet with one of our mental health therapists just as a psycho-educational visit to go over these types of questions and best practices around what to tell the child, when to tell the child.
Starting point is 01:54:09
General rule is tell them early and tell them often. You basically want to normalize the thing. And you definitely want to be the ones to tell them and you don't want them to find out by some other means, like somebody context them on 23andMe or something like that. And early means what? Telling them before they understand reproduction? Like how are you telling them? Yeah, I mean, again, it's a little outside my area
Starting point is 01:54:36
of expertise, but when they're quite young, like it could be like four to six years of age, it might depend on the child and how mature they are, etc. But basically, there's different ways to introduce the concept. Obviously, if it's a same-sex couple or if it's a single person, it might happen earlier as opposed to a straight couple. So if someone's listening to this and they're trying to figure out how to select a good IVF clinic, what are the things they should be looking for? Because I would have to assume out how to select a good IVF clinic. What are the things they should be looking for?
Starting point is 01:55:07
Because I would have to assume that it's like any other field of medicine. Not all doctors and not all clinics are created equal. And just because you see a lot of advertising doesn't tell you anything. So in other words, you're going to have to become a very, very intelligent consumer. For most people, this will be the single most expensive out of pocket healthcare expense they have. Yeah, that's true. And so it's not just that it's the most expensive healthcare decision they're ever going to make. It might be one of the most consequential as well. And yet I know what I suggest to
Starting point is 01:55:44
people when someone says, Peter, you know, my wife and I are thinking about getting IVF, what do you think? I just go down the rabbit hole of like, here's a hundred questions I would ask. And it usually begins with, tell me your success rate individually. I don't care about the national success rate. It means nothing to me. So how would you counsel someone who's trying to come up with their checklist of questions to ask?
Starting point is 01:56:06
These days is a little bit easier because obviously there's the internet and there's suggested questions online you could look at. It's true there is some variability amongst clinics although there's a lot of consolidation happening in the field as well. So a lot of the practices are becoming common to most clinics. But some of it is practical, right? Like which clinics are close to where you live, because as- You have to go in and get these ultrasounds. Yeah, you gotta go in every few days,
Starting point is 01:56:30
so you can't be going to another state. Most people can't. But in most major cities, you have multiple options. In most major cities, that's true. So you're right about individual clinic success rates, although technically it's hard to use those to compare them to each other because you don't necessarily know the population, right? You don't know the patient population, right.
Starting point is 01:56:50
So how do you normalize it? Right. So one thing for sure, look at the success rates. And we're one of the few fields of medicine where actually you can get clinic-specific success rates. You mean publicly it's available or? Yeah, it's available. Where do you find it?
Starting point is 01:57:03
Well, the CDC, up until recently, there is a law actually that says you have to report every IVF cycle and the success rate that was passed in the 90s. So because of that, the CDC tracks this. Although all the people that work in that department were fired recently. So you don't know what's going to happen with that.
Starting point is 01:57:20
But also our professional organization is called Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology. Has a website, it's called SART.org is the URL. And all the clinics in the US or most of them are on there. And they have to report their success rates and they're published every year. There's usually like a two year lag because the babies have to be born and everything.
Starting point is 01:57:41
So I would send people to that website first. Look at the clinics in your area, look at the success rates, keeping in mind that populations might be different in different clinics. I probably would go to a clinic that does a sufficient volume. You have to do at least 100 cycles, I would say,
Starting point is 01:57:59
but ideally more than that. Your clinic has how many doctors? Our clinic has about six doctors. How many total cycles do you guys do a year? We do six to 800 retrievals a year. There's a lot of variability. There's some clinics that do thousands. There's some that do like 50.
Starting point is 01:58:18
So that would be one factor that I think is important, just volume. And you have how many embryologists? We have something like nine embryologists. Yeah, there is a shortage of embryologists nationwide and reproductive endocrinologists because the demand for IVF is going up. So I would definitely look at the clinic success rates, look at the volume.
Starting point is 01:58:38
The other thing with the internet especially, you can look at patient reviews, word of mouth. Gotta take those with a grain of salt, right? Yeah, they tend to be negative selecting, so. Right, not everybody who has a great experience necessarily gonna post it on Reddit. But everyone who has a bad one does. Yeah, yeah, so you have to take that with a grain of salt.
Starting point is 01:58:55
But there are objective ways, and you can also interview your doctor. Yeah, what are questions you should be asking of the doctor that are independent of the objective metrics that we might have just discussed. You can ask about their philosophy, about protocols, about things like add-ons, like genetic testing, for example. It's like, are you a clinic where everybody is encouraged to do a genetic testing?
Starting point is 01:59:19
That's not necessarily the clinic I would choose. You talk to the patient about the pros and cons and you let the patient decide and we do a lot of genetic testing so it's not like I'm against it or anything but you want to get a sense of the vibe of the clinic. Are they just interested in money? Not that doctors ever think like that but you know what I mean. So sometimes it takes having a consultation with one or more clinics to see where you feel more comfortable. I'm a little bit biased towards some academic centers just because our missions include education and research, et cetera. But there's several very excellent private clinics as
Starting point is 01:59:57
well. What would be some red flags if you're going through this process? How much of a delta is there in cost within a same city? Or did prices tend to converge within a given geography? Yeah, within a given geography, they're pretty similar and it's not cheap. Yeah, so what are we at today? Fully loaded cost? So, you know, an IVF cycle is probably around $20,000 per cycle. But that doesn't include genetic testing or does?
Starting point is 02:00:20
Including genetic testing per cycle. But how does that compare to 20 years ago? Is that more or less inflation? AMT – Prices like most things have gone up. SL – It has? AMT – Yeah. SL – Okay. I guess it should go up just based on the cost of labor that goes into all these things.
Starting point is 02:00:34
AMT – Yeah, and there's... SL – Even though the genetic testing is coming down. AMT – Yeah, innovations and things like that. You think as volume goes up, eventually prices go down, but that hasn't quite happened. As new things get out of it, then it just tends to become more expensive. And most people are probably still paying out of pocket. Most people are not getting this covered by insurance. Again, depends where you live.
Starting point is 02:00:52
Yeah, but across the country. Yeah. I think there are now 24 states that offer some kind of fertility coverage. About 15 of them include IVF. So you're right. Most places, they're paying out of pocket if your employer doesn't happen to offer infertility insurance coverage. So red flags, communication with the clinic. So a lot of your experience is going to be communicating with nurses and coordinators. Yeah, you want to get a sense of what that is like,
Starting point is 02:01:24
because that could be stressful if it's not smooth. And oftentimes, our clinic included, sometimes it's not smooth. I mean, there have been some things we try and do, like texting and apps and things to make the communication easier and doesn't always work the way it's supposed to. You want to get time with your doctor. So some clinics, you hardly ever
Starting point is 02:01:45
see the doctor and you see maybe the ultrasonographer. Not that that's bad, but it's kind of nice. Some patients prefer to have that more frequent interaction with their actual provider. So there's probably a sweet spot in volume where it's probably an inverted U-shape where if they're too low, they don't have the reps. If they're too high, it's a bit of a sweatshop and a factory. It can be, yeah. You want in the middle there. Let's pivot now and talk about a few other things. So what's on the horizon medically
Starting point is 02:02:09
for extending fertility? So there's a study going on at Columbia that's looking at the use of rapamycin to extend fertility in women. Now, I have to be honest with you. There was a day when I knew what the study was and what the inclusion criteria were. I don't at the moment.
Starting point is 02:02:25
I'm assuming you are more familiar with this than I am. What is the question that is being asked and how is it being asked in this study? So, there's a lot of interest in extending fertility. Up until 100 years ago, women were basically dying at 50 in the average age of menopause. So, it's a recent phenomenon that we're actually living a third of our lives post-menopause. And fertility starts to decline way before you go through menopause. So there's a lot of interest in trying to extend fertility.
Starting point is 02:02:53
Now, of course, egg freezing, which we haven't talked about yet, is one of the ways you can extend fertility. And it works pretty well as long as you're young when you freeze your eggs. But again, it's a relatively recent phenomenon. You're not usually covered by insurance, and it's expensive, et cetera, so it's not the answer.
Starting point is 02:03:09
Because you're paying basically half the IVF cycle to harvest, and then you're paying to freeze. Yeah, exactly. What's the cost of freezing? Well, $10,000 for the cycle. And then about $1,000 a year for storage. And you're recommending that if a woman came to you at 20 and said, I just want to double down on my career right now.
Starting point is 02:03:29
I want to do X, Y, and Z. I think I want to have kids. I at least want the optionality. When should I freeze by? Are you going to just say do it now? Because no. I wouldn't recommend all women in their 20s freeze their eggs because most of those eggs will never be used. So you'd be doing it for nothing
Starting point is 02:03:45
because most of those women probably not need IVF and get pregnant spontaneously, right? Got it, okay. The sweet spot we think is like early to mid 30s. That's where it makes the most sense. Cause you're about to get to the probability cliff where it starts to really decline. Right, if you think you might wanna have kids
Starting point is 02:04:02
but you're not in a place in your life where you think that's gonna happen in the next few years, then doing it early to mid-30s is probably the time where it's most cost-effective. Very high likelihood that you will use them, if not for the first kid, maybe for the second kid. And it might be worth spending $10,000 in a thousand dollars a year. In a thousand bucks a year. Right. And do you freeze them, you freeze every egg you retrieve?
Starting point is 02:04:27
Only the mature ones. Okay. Yeah. And what's the, for a typical 30-year-old, you're going to get what we talked about earlier? Probably 10 to 15 per cycle, sometimes more, but that's average. And how many do you recommend a 30-year-old do? Yeah. So there's some calculators online.
Starting point is 02:04:43
So the younger you are, the fewer eggs you need because more of them are going to be normal. So someone 30, I think 10 to 20 would give you a decent chance of success. No guarantees, there's never any guarantees. But studies show that even if people use those eggs and then are not successful, the fact that they did something proactively, there's some psychological benefit in doing that. So even if ultimately doesn't work out or you don't end up using them. But at that age, maybe 10 to 20, as you get closer to 40, you might need 20 to 40 or 50, which is not practical
Starting point is 02:05:16
for most people because you can't do that many cycles and it's expensive and there's risks involved. So I think egg freezing is a great option for women. I also think as a society, we should try to make it easier, obviously, for women to have kids during their peak reproductive years in their 20s and 30s. A whole different question, but I think having options is a good thing. So back to the rapamycin question,
Starting point is 02:05:39
they're basically saying, look, is there a way that we could push that out a little bit? And so how is the study testing this? So rapamycin, as some of your listeners may know, is used in other anti-aging type contexts. There's some animal data that shows that maybe rapamycin might extend fertility in that. Remember the egg cell death that we talked about earlier by like preventing that to some degree so that the eggs last longer and you're fertile for more years. So there's some data in mice primarily.
Starting point is 02:06:14
There's some data show that it's not helpful as well. So the data I would say is mixed in animal models. And the study at Columbia is actually trying to test it in humans. I believe it's a few months study where they're giving relatively low dose of repamycin, I forget exactly, maybe five milligrams daily. Daily, not weekly. I think it's daily. Okay, interesting.
Starting point is 02:06:34
But I'm not 100% sure. We'll pull it up and put it in the show notes. I should have known this. And then I think their outcome marker is AMH. I believe it's that hormone. So I don't know. It's a relatively inexpensive study. They're not invasively looking at follicles.
Starting point is 02:06:48
What you'd have to believe then is in just a period of a few months, you could pick up a signal of more or less AMH reduction. Right. And even if you can, what does that mean really? This study could be negative. If this study is positive, it's interesting. If it's negative, it probably doesn't tell us much,
Starting point is 02:07:07
if it's only three to six months. Right. To really do the study, I mean, you'd need long-term. You need a few years. Right. You need pregnancy outcomes or at least menstrual menopause, age of menopause. So that would take for a long time.
Starting point is 02:07:21
And you'd have to take it for many years, probably. That's gonna be a really difficult question to answer in humans. Yeah. Again, because of the animal data not being consistent, some studies show, yeah, maybe it's helpful, but other studies show that it might be actually harmful because of the way it acts
Starting point is 02:07:38
as being immunosuppressive and things. So certainly for any listeners trying to conceive, I would not recommend rapamycin. But yes, I'm curious about the data coming out of Columbia and other studies. Are there any other things that a woman can do to maximize her fertility beyond, we've already addressed sort of PCOS, we've already addressed the metabolic stuff. But we hear things all the time like stress, sleep. I mean, these things seem self-evident, but what would be the most common things
Starting point is 02:08:08
you would be saying to a woman who is otherwise experiencing iatrogenic, for lack of a better word, infertility? Yeah, I think all those things are important, like lifestyle factors. They're rarely the sole cause of infertility, but they can certainly exacerbate infertility as well as any other disease.
Starting point is 02:08:28
So I think the lifestyle factors that promote health are generally the same lifestyle factors that promote fertility. So healthy diet. 1. Soterios Johnson Is there anything we can say more on that? Like what is a healthy diet as it pertains to fertility? Is it different? Does a woman who's getting ready to conceive, does she need more fat in her Like, what is a healthy diet as it pertains to fertility? Is it different? Does a woman who's getting ready to conceive, does she need more fat in her diet, for example?
Starting point is 02:08:49
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As you probably know, the data on diet is not great for anything, especially not fertility. So, I would say there's very little evidence that there's a particular diet that's good for fertility that's different than what's good in general. So for most of my patients, I recommend the Mediterranean diet. That diet is palatable most people and has fair amount of evidence that it's reasonably healthy and that's a lot of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, protein, mostly from fish and olive oil and those types of things. It's not that different from what I would recommend for anybody.
Starting point is 02:09:27
By the way, I think I said iatrogenic. I meant idiopathic, but you know what I meant. So what about supplements? I'm sure you get asked this question all the time. There's no shortage of over-the-counter supplements that people report increased fertility. I get asked these questions all the time and have blank stares because I don't know. Is there anything you can point to? I love framework. Maybe one framework is, are there supplements that correct legitimate deficiencies like vitamin D or B vitamins where
Starting point is 02:09:55
we could make a case that supplementing with these things happen? I'm talking beyond just the prenatal vitamins that are obvious and necessary. We'll leave that to the side because it's so self-evident versus supplementsus supplements that are kind of more grab bag, mystery supplements where you're not actually correcting some obvious deficiency, but we think it might increase fertility. So the data around supplements, even less robust than the data around diet,
Starting point is 02:10:18
I would say yes, if you're correcting deficiencies, I think you can make a case for that. So as a lot of women, reproductive age women, are iron deficient, for example. They might need to be on iron supplements. You mentioned prenatal vitamins. Obviously folic acid is important for anybody trying to get pregnant. People who live in Portland, Oregon, like I do, we tend to be vitamin D deficient. So I usually recommend vitamin D for people.
Starting point is 02:10:43
But other supplements specifically for fertility, the ones I most commonly hear about are things like CoQ10 or DHEA is another one. And there's some data that it might be helpful. Again, it's not very robust. DHEA? DHEA. Which just increases endogenous testosterone production.
Starting point is 02:11:03
It improves egg quality, like who knows how it works. Interesting. Yeah. I mean, the data isn't great. Might improve libido. Maybe. I think people have studied that. It doesn't work so well.
Starting point is 02:11:13
It is a weak androgen, you're right. Yeah, the data is not very promising. But so for most of these things, the data is not there and probably will never be there, right? Because there's symptoms that aren't there to do those studies. So it probably doesn't hurt though. And so I'm relatively supportive.
Starting point is 02:11:28
If a patient wants to take Coquita and there's some data around it, sure. Do you think it's just psychological where if they take it and they feel that they're doing something better, it reduces their stress around it? Like, because for me, I can't help but think that stress has such a negative impact on fertility
Starting point is 02:11:44
and on many aspects of health, but it's so difficult to quantify. We don't have a biomarker for stress. Even measuring cortisol doesn't actually tell you anything about the experience of stress. And so I just think so many negative health outcomes are a result of it and therefore anything that a person can do to improve their stress. I agree with you. And if taking supplements helps with that, sure.
Starting point is 02:12:05
I'm all for it. Yeah, I'm not advocating that we should be going crazy on it with no evidence. But I wonder if any of the efficacy of those things is mediated through that reduction of stress. Possibly, yeah. And as long as it's not harmful, that's great. And when we say the data is in there,
Starting point is 02:12:19
it's just because it doesn't mean that it doesn't work. It's just nobody's shown one way or another whether it works. So it's quite possible. CoQ10 has some effect that we doesn't work. It's just nobody's shown one way or another whether it works. So it's quite possible CoQ10 has some effect that we don't know about. And my feeling is if I don't think it's harmful and patient wants to take it, maybe helps with their stress. Sure, I'm for that. Other things, stress, almost everybody has some degree
Starting point is 02:12:39
of stress in their lives, some more than others, unfortunately, but it's really hard to get rid of all the stress. Like, it's not helpful to tell a patient, well. You just need to be less stressed. You just need to be less stressed. So, like, okay, now what? But finding ways to cope with the stress
Starting point is 02:12:54
is really what we're talking about. And that can be different for different people. For some people, it could be exercise. For some people, it could be meditation. For some people, whatever, mindfulness. Social support, yoga. Whatever it is. But mindfulness, whatever it is. But definitely it's important, same as sleep and we talked about diet, exercise is important.
Starting point is 02:13:12
Do you caution women or do we know anything about too much exercise for women who are trying to conceive? I mean, we certainly hear stories about college athletes and women who are doing a lot are actually having difficulty even maintaining a regular menstrual cycle So if you're dealing with a woman when you're taking that social history and you're trying to understand What are some clues to you that her exercise might actually be too much and that might be impacting her fertility? Extreme exercise can be associated with fertility issues. Although I think for most patients the benefits of exercise as we know Yeah, what is extreme in this case?
Starting point is 02:13:45
So if it causes any change in a person's cycle, so for some of the more extreme athletes, sometimes their periods will stop altogether. There's a condition called reds. It's relative energy deficiency in sport. And basically, the body's very smart. If it thinks there's not enough energy around to support a pregnancy,
Starting point is 02:14:02
because we're expending it all on this exercise. We're just gonna shut the whole thing down and it works really well, but the patient stops menstruating. So obviously they're gonna have difficulty getting pregnant if they're not ovulating. If you're not menstruating means you're not ovulating. Also has other implications for things like bone health because the ovary in addition to making eggs also makes estrogen and estrogen super important for bone health. So one lesson for the listeners, keep track of your, we talked about semen analysis being kind of a marker of other health outcomes.
Starting point is 02:14:34
Your periods are also a marker. Of course, if you're on hormonal contraception, you might not know what your natural cycle is doing. But if your cycles are irregular or if you're not having them at all, or if they're super painful or they're super heavy, and sometimes you don't know what's super painful or super heavy because nobody talks about anything. But thankfully this generation of young women is talking more and there's the internet etc. but don't wait till you're ready to try to get pregnant to figure that out. There
Starting point is 02:14:59
may be something important you need to know way ahead of time. So. And we've already talked about obesity but on the other side of that, is there a certain body fat level beneath which fertility is also impacted? Yeah, there's not a cutoff, but certainly being overweight or obese can impact fertility and being severely underweight. For the underweight people, it's a similar mechanism if your brain thinks there's just not enough. It's usually gonna manifest through amenorrhea.
Starting point is 02:15:26
Exactly, exactly. So healthy weight, healthy diet, exercise, sleep, disrupted sleep could affect ovulation and fertility. Stress, we mentioned all these things. All the things you mentioned in your book as well are all the same things that are important for fertility. Lastly, what do you think is the most promising area of research? If we're sitting here in 10 years and we're talking about this and we're looking back at the last decade, what do you imagine you will be most excited about from an innovation perspective?
Starting point is 02:16:00
It's a very exciting field of medicine. There's always sort of innovations happening. I think, let's see, genetic testing will continue to evolve as we learn more about genetics. I think that'll play a bigger role. Automation in the lab, a lot of the steps we talked about earlier are like literally embryologists sitting at the microscope doing these things, but now there's some companies developing these lab on a chip concepts where like you put in the egg, put in the sperm, an embryo comes out at the other end. doing these things, but now there's some companies developing these lab-on-a-chip concepts
Starting point is 02:16:25
where you put in the egg, put in the sperm, an embryo comes out at the other end. So microfluidics or? Yeah, microfluidics, the whole process being automated. It's very interesting, right? And it could potentially improve access if you could put these labs. So do you see this as more of a cost reduction
Starting point is 02:16:43
or more of a success improvement? Maybe both because reduce error potentially. Usually the cost of things tends to go up any time there's an innovation. Before it comes down, maybe ultimately it'll come down, but imagine costs will increase. So that's kind of an exciting area. In vitro maturation, that's where the eggs are maturing in the petri dish instead
Starting point is 02:17:06
of in a woman's body. So potentially in the future, a woman wouldn't have to take all these injections and just take the immature eggs, put them in the petri dish, and then give the petri dish the medications, if you will. That's in very sort of early stages, not quite as successful as conventional IVF yet, so we're not quite there. I assume because it's difficult to harvest un-mature follicles. Partly, and even that maturation process, we haven't quite gotten it down like it happens in the body.
Starting point is 02:17:36
Other things, a real game changer would be something like in-vitro gametogenesis, which is making eggs and sperm potentially from skin cells. So even if you run out of eggs, if we could take like a skin biopsy and reprogram that cell to make an egg, then potentially anybody- Where are we in that? Very early. I think we'll see it eventually.
Starting point is 02:18:00
It's been done in mice. So we're probably 10 to 20 years away. What's the obstacle? Basically reprogramming skin cells. It just, the whole process is very complicated and not easy. People are trying, there are a couple of companies that are trying to do it. Meaning, is the challenge taking the skin cell
Starting point is 02:18:19
back to a stem cell and then the stem cell into- Differentiating it. Yeah. And which of those two steps do we think is harder, skin cell back to stem cell or stem cell into egg? I think they're both hard. I don't know. There's a couple of different approaches, including we work, do research in this area
Starting point is 02:18:34
as well where we're taking essentially the nucleus from a skin cell and putting it... Into an egg. Into an egg. And just replacing the genetic material. Yes. Yes. Exactly. So we don't have to reprogram the skin cell. And is it easy to separate the chromosomes? No.
Starting point is 02:18:50
Okay, I was going to say. No. It's very complicated because it's meiosis. It's hard for it to happen efficiently and equally, et cetera. So we're working on it, but we're probably 10, 20 years away. But that would be an alternative way to get to that. But then you need donor eggs, so that has its own limitations, because it's not like donor eggs
Starting point is 02:19:09
are easy to come by either. Yeah, that's true. Although I guess what it does is it helps the older woman who is able to make follicles, but they're just aneuploidic. Exactly, yeah. You have a solution to that problem. Yeah, yeah.
Starting point is 02:19:23
Another thing we're working on is something called mitochondrial replacement therapy where basically similar concept, you were taking like you have an older woman, let's say, she undergoes IVF. You have a donor that undergoes IVF, but you take the nucleus out of the older egg and you put it in a younger egg. So essentially the cytoplasm is from the young egg including the mitochondria. So we think part of the aging is,
Starting point is 02:19:50
just like other aspects of aging, acquired mutations in the mitochondria. So you have young cytoplasm, young mitochondria, maybe those eggs will do better or that nucleus will do better in that young egg. Unfortunately, we can't do that in the United States legally but we're doing trials in other countries. This is kind of a remarkable field. Again, it's still amazing to me how well this works.
Starting point is 02:20:13
If you think about it, this is, and I don't mean this in a disparaging way at all, it's very brute force. It's very mechanical. And yet we're, as a field, I think having an enormous impact that is relatively recent when you sort of think about the timescale of this. So it seems to me that early intervention is better. Your point about women who have any sort of irregularity in their cycle, if they're in their teens or 20s, if for no other reason beyond just the discomfort of it at the moment, getting this looked at now is a great way to get ahead of an infertility problem 10 years hence. For sure.
Starting point is 02:20:53
That to me is a very important takeaway that I don't think is probably appreciated enough. And while I don't think we have a high listenership of 18-year-old girls, my guess is that message through parents who are listening might make its way to potential future patients that would find themselves on your doorstep. It's also comforting to hear just how high the probability of success is in the modern era today. And it sounds to me like we're converging on quality. Whereas I would imagine this was a field that was a bit like the Wild West 20 years ago, where you had a bunch of charlatans out there who were,
Starting point is 02:21:28
maybe not charlatans is the wrong word, but just low quality practitioners. And I'm guessing today with consolidation of groups, we're seeing less and less of that. More standardization, yes, for sure. I'm still blown away at the concept of the embryologist and what's required to do that and how that we don't have a more formal training path, especially given that you said that we have a shortage of such people. That seems like an incredibly rewarding career for somebody. So hopefully we can foster that. Paula, this has been great. I feel between this podcast and the podcast on male fertility, I have a much better sense of
