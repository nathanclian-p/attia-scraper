Hi, my name is Olivia Attia. Today's guest is... Peter Attia. Welcome to the Peter Tia Drive, Peter Attia. Hmm, that's weird. This is like Oprah making the cover of Oprah Magazine. Okay, this is a preview of what's to come on the podcast and a little about you. It's the Clark Griswold episode.

00. First things first. Who are you and why the heck are you making a podcast? Does the world really need another podcast? Well, fair question, maybe it doesn't, but I'll start with who I am. My name is Peter Atia as you've already stated. I'm a physician and a guy who's interested in a bunch of things and I've spent a lot of years writing about them and I decided it was maybe time to start podcasting. A number of my friends, people like Tim Ferriss, Kevin Rose, Jaco, Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Anahado Conner, have been sort of cajoling me into doing one for some time now. What does cajoling mean? Like to, you know, sort of trying to talk me into it.

Anyway, so I realize now having been a guest on a number of podcasts that doing one of my own could be kind of a remarkable opportunity to talk to and learn from some really smart and interesting people and to share experiences with them. There's kind of a freedom in this structure that I guess I find a little bit more appealing at this time than just writing. So I guess that's probably the reason why I think it's time to start working on this. Why is your podcast called The Drive? Have you considered calling it the ice cream? I bet you get more downloads at least from me and my friends. Yeah, that's probably true, and don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not really catering to you
Starting point is 00:01:49
and your friends on this one. I'm calling it the drive because I think it's a bit of a play on two themes. The first is, I think when you're exploring topics, sometimes it's like going on a drive, and you don't necessarily know where you're going and you're winding through the roads. And of course at the other end of that, it's anybody who knows me knows I really enjoy driving. So I guess I just didn't want to call it the Peter Atias show. Now as I mentioned, I think over the last few years, I've, especially as I've been researching for the book, I've had a lot of opportunity to speak with some really, really awesome people on topics that interest me if not outright consume me. Things like lipidology, endocrinology, IGF, rapamycin, etophagy, emtore, and then of course

I also think would be fun to talk about erotincena watches and pens. I'm sure you know what the 80-20 rule is right? Uh, why don't you refresh my memory and while you're at it what the heck is mTOR? Is that the thing you have on your license plate? Uh, yes, look at you. All right, yes that's right. I do have mTOR on my license plate and I won't get into what mTOR is now. The 80-20 rule is that basically, or it's a variation of this theme where you can sort of put in 20% of the effort to get 80% of the results.
Starting point is 00:03:14
And while I think that that's a wonderful principle, I sort of find myself obsessed with the last 20% meaning how do you go from 80% of the results to 100% of the results, although of course that's an elusive, impossible task. But luckily there are a lot of people out there who are close to that 100% than I'll ever be and I guess part of my hope with doing this podcast is being able to sort of talk to those people, learn from them and in the process hopefully give people who are listening something interesting to learn about and understand as well. And you're going to talk about Arit and Senna and watches too?
Starting point is 00:03:49
I mean, almost assuredly at some point, yeah, I guess there's no point in having a podcast if you can't talk about all the things that you enjoy. And I certainly do enjoy things that have to do with Arit and Senna and watches and race cars and all sorts of other things like you know, stuff we won't talk about necessarily right now. Hmm. How many podcasts have you recorded so far? I think four or five out of what I had planned to do which was record 12 out of the gate. The goal is to finish that up by the end of June and then from July on just
Starting point is 00:04:26
release the 12 over the summer. If the feedback is positive, then I say we just keep doing it in perpetuity. And if the feedback says, hey, your podcast sucks, then it didn't really take that much time. It was just 12 episodes and no harm, no foul, and I'll get back to doing whatever it is I do. Where can people find you? On social, all the usual suspects, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. My username is Peter, T.A.M.D. though I probably spend more time on Twitter than the others. In fact, I would say that if you have questions, Twitter is great a place to find me as anywhere,

and it's also a great place to share your favorite Chevy Chase movie references. Since the podcast does not do out for a while, how can people be alerted to its arrival? Well, they could sign up on our site, which is peteratia-md.com-forward-slash-podcast. Presumably you can also do something in iTunes to be alerted to it, but that goes beyond my level of technical understanding. Eventually on the podcast, once the episode starts going up, you'll find show notes, reading materials, related links, and of course you can find the blog and Nerd Safari there as well.
Starting point is 00:05:34
Nerd Safari? What the heck is Nerd Safari? Well, how long? Glad you like it so much. Why don't you just click on the Nerd Safari link at the top of the home site and you can learn more. Another thing you could do while you're there is sign up for a subjectively non-lame once a week email I try to send out to my friends. I usually include whatever is most interesting to me that week with respect to papers that I've read or things that just strike me as interesting.

Well Peter Othia, thank you for joining me on the inaugural episode of the Peter Ahtia Drive. I hope the rest of the guests are more interesting than you have been. Just kidding. Heck.
