what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now, head over to peteratia MD dot com forward slash subscribe. Now without further delay, here's today's episode. I guess this week is Dr. Paul Conti. This is a name that may sound familiar to some of you as Paul was one of our initial guests back in September 2018. I believe it was episode number 15. Paul is a practicing psychiatrist and recent author of trauma, the invisible epidemic, how trauma works and how we can heal from it. A book that brings
Starting point is 00:01:11
his valuable insights about how we can collectively heal from trauma's effects to a larger audience. Paul is a graduate of Stanford University Med School, which is where we met. He completed his psychiatry training at Stanford and Harvard, where he was appointed Chief Resident. He then served on the medical faculty before moving to Portland and founding a clinic. This episode and my conversation with Paul is focused primarily around trauma. And in that, we discuss a number of things. We talk about Paul's upbringing and his experience and how that got him interested in studying medicine and ultimately psychiatry and trauma specifically.
Starting point is 00:01:42
We look at the impact of trauma on the brain, patterns around trauma, and how often people don't recognize the implications of trauma in their life. We talk about the lack of biomarkers in psychiatry and psychology, the misguidance around trauma and the mental health system, how we kind of treat trauma as a symptom, as opposed to going after the problem,
Starting point is 00:01:58
and the importance of lowering the barrier around trauma so that people can begin to receive help. From there, we look at the shame that comes with trauma, how shame is often the thing that prevents people from getting help, and how we can start to change the stigma around that shame that comes with past trauma. We end the discussion with a conversation around psilocybin and MDMA and their potential in this space. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with my good friend Paul Conti.

Paul, amazing to be back here in person with you. Thank you. It's been way too long and the only thing I miss, not the only thing, but one of the things I miss the most about going to New York frequently was that we got to see each other constantly. And now that we don't really travel that much, it's mostly phone calls. But we got to spend so much time together and I do miss that too. And it's just really wonderful to see you. And I still appreciate you having me here and spending time with you and family. It's wonderful. I mean, except to talk about your book, of course, but I think even though a lot of people have heard you on
Starting point is 00:03:05
the podcast before, because we did, we sat down probably three years ago, I'd probably take the assumption here that a lot of people are also hearing about you here for the first time. So let's tell people a little bit about who you are. What's your day job? What does it you do? Sure. I'm trained as a psychiatrist. And a big part of my day job is being a clinical psychiatrist. I also do some consulting work along the lines of understanding brain function and how brain function can impact us
Starting point is 00:03:34
in personal or professional settings. But by and large, my work is really grounded in the clinical. And I do have a clinic about 15 really great people I work side by side with and trying to meet the needs of people who bring us whatever mental health question there maybe which sometimes is clinical care and sometimes is just trying to understand themselves in the world around them better. When is it in your journey of medical school and prior that you sort of had this inkling that you were interested in mental health. I think around the time in the clinical rotation part of medical school probably into the last year when I realized that you could like really be a doctor and understand medical things and how they
Starting point is 00:04:16
impact people and really going to be grounded in that aspect of like practicing medicine, but also trying to understand people's experiences of life. Like, what do people think and feel as they're going through their day, and that you could combine these two things and then be grounded to all the things one learns about life, just going through it and really help people in that way. And that just adds such tremendous appeal as a sort of widely encompassing way of approaching try to be of help. You of course didn't come to medical school in a typical way. You were not a pre-med. You had been out and working for four years or so before medical school, if not more.
Starting point is 00:04:56
So what were you doing first of all before you made this decision to go to medical school? I worked for consulting firm in New York and really enjoyed a lot of aspects of the work, the business and the financial aspects of it. But there was just something I wanted more, you know, I wanted to know more and learn more and we'd be more directly involved with people. And it was kind of a nebulous sort of theoretical set of thoughts, but you know, it led to medical school to try and learn more and explore, like what might that be able to bring? We've spoken about this obviously before. You write about it in the book. There are a handful of events that occurred during your, you're upbringing,
Starting point is 00:05:35
your adolescence that I think ultimately shaped how you now think about this thing called trauma. You want to talk about some of those things? Sure. I had a really interesting course of life in the sense that in kind of the first half of my life, there weren't major traumas. So I was fortunate to have a stable family system around me and to develop a pretty stable sense of self, which is much easier to do if there aren't big traumas. And then in the second half of my life, there started to be some very major traumas. And to experience the traumas after having developed an orientation to myself and to the world that had been free of them, was very, very striking.
Starting point is 00:06:20
I think it put me in a place to see, even though I didn't completely understand them, but like what was going on in me and what was changing in me and what were the impacts of the trauma on me in a way that was distressing and surprising. And I think that's also part of what led me towards mental health. We're seeing like, wow, these things are happening in me. And then there's a set of thoughts that come from that of like, well, what happens if you experience these traumas and you don't have the good fortune ever stable family system around you and have developed a strong sense of self because my sense of self was really thrown off by the
Starting point is 00:06:54
traumas that happened even though I had kind of gotten through those formative stages without that. How old were you when your brother committed suicide? So I would be 24, 24th of the time that he committed suicide. And at the risk of asking an obvious, or maybe not some obvious question, how shocked were you at that time? Because you hear these tragedies of someone commit suicide and everybody around says, well, it was just a matter of time.
Starting point is 00:07:24
It was this almost seemed inevitable. And then you hear these other stories where everybody around is in such disbelief. So they're really coping with not just the loss, but the feeling blindsided and guilty. And how did we not see this? And so where on that spectrum were you? And I guess by extension, your family in the shock and disbelief side of the spectrum, which I think like a lot of families that go through this, if one stood from the outside and looked at the development of events and what was really going on and what was changing in my brother, he had had a huge trauma, a
Starting point is 00:07:59
few years before where he had a very significant medical issue that had come out of the blue and was life-threatening and really shook his sense of self. And he was very different after that in ways that I could see in some sense, but not fully understand. So I think from the outside, one probably could have seen that there were these changes in him that would have meant it was not necessarily that shocking. But from the inside, we often don't see that,
Starting point is 00:08:26
or we have our mechanisms of denial or rationalization that tell us like, no, things are pretty okay when really they weren't. And then the shock of it happening and then of realizing, oh, like, what could I have seen, what I have seen? I think it contributes to a lot of the guilt and the shame that people feel. It's a bad combination, an immense amount of shock. And then immediately thereafter, a sense of guilt and responsibility. And also a sense that if there haven't been big traumas that, oh, like they don't happen, that's not something that happens to me or happens to us. And I think we can get into that mindset because it sort of psychologically protects us a little bit, but it can make the shock of a trauma like that in a sense, all the more difficult,
Starting point is 00:09:13
because we start to feel cursed or unworthy. Like, you know, there's some mark of stigma that I think is just very, very frightening. How did your other brother, your parents cope with this and how did you talk about it with them or what was discussed and how did you all move on in the immediate aftermath of that? I think my other brother and I were sort of built in somewhat the same way of like kind of continuing to persevere and trying to find something new that can make life feel better, which often means working toward achievements, applying ourselves, which can be quite a good defense against trauma. I think in my parents, it was a little different. My
Starting point is 00:09:56
father's a morse of outgoing, gregarious person and was able to fall into a social network that was really supportive of him, whereas my mother who has since passed away was more of a private person less socially connected and I think ultimately suffered from a lot of depression without her or us really understanding it. And I think that's part of what pushes so strongly towards my interest in trauma
Starting point is 00:10:23
is the realization of like all the things we didn't understand or understood enough to know, like weren't good, but didn't have the words or the understanding to really talk about it and to talk about like what had happened and what it meant and the changes to all of us that we don't have a ready lexicon or a ready environment to be able to talk about things and then people at times sort of retreat into themselves
Starting point is 00:10:51
and then the trauma stays very, very immediate even though that immediacy can play out over years and years. So I think we were very ill-equipped. Like I think most people, you know, we were ill-equipped to handle a massive trauma and its impact upon all of us individually let alone the greater complexity of all of us as a family. Is it more common that in a situation like that where a child commits suicide and the parents and siblings are left picking up the pieces that very little is spoken explicitly. I mean, I think about the stories in my life of people I grew up with who for whom suicide was an issue. So I mean, I had a girlfriend in college whose mom committed suicide, had a very close friend in high school whose dad committed suicide, had another girlfriend in high school whose dad committed suicide. And one of these had a very tragic outcome.
Starting point is 00:11:46
The one there was a friend whose dad committed suicide. He later committed suicide. And that was an example of where I thought to myself. And it's something I felt very guilty about because I was in college and my mom called me to tell me he wasn't doing well. And it was in April and it was during finals. And she said, you know, and his dad had committed suicide two years earlier. And she said, look, he's really,
Starting point is 00:12:10
he just doesn't seem like he's doing well. I said, well, you know, like I did to this day, I just feel so ashamed over this. You know, I said, I'm going to be home in like three weeks. I'll connect with him then. But, you know, at that moment in my life, nothing seemed more important than graduating first in my class and anything that was gonna stand in the way of that was I couldn't go home for a weekend at my mom's request And of course about time I got home. It was too late. He was dead And I just wondered like it's so obvious and yet I did nothing What was talked about what else was being done?
Starting point is 00:12:42
and yet I did nothing. What was talked about? What else was being done? So not to dwell on this too much, but I'm just curious how much you remember in the months after your brother's death, was there a time where you sat around the kitchen table and said, boy, it would really be great if we had a therapist here that could help us process
Starting point is 00:12:59
what's going on? Or after the funeral was it sort of like, nope, we're all kind of going to do our own mechanism of coping. I mean, there was some discussion about it. I think partly because maybe the generation, I mean, I mean, I hadn't been to medical school yet, so I had no knowledge of anything, but I'm maybe a little more inclined to want to talk about things like I could tell, like, we all seem not to be doing well, but I didn't know the
Starting point is 00:13:25
words to put to it. I mean, we don't, in a sense, give ourselves permission to have like words of immensity, right, of impact of, oh, my whole existence feels different. Like, we don't quite know or feel a sense of permission to say those things. And then often the reflexive nature of shame those things. And then often the reflexive nature of shame causes us to go inside. And I think that's a primary point that I wish to make about trauma is that there is a reflexive shame that comes of being traumatized. The same shame we see if someone is assaulted and then presents talking about the assault through the lens of their shame that it happened. These powerful stories that reinforce the reflexive nature of a sense of shame that drives us inward.
Starting point is 00:14:11
So we don't have the words for it, and we feel very, very bad about it. Even the trauma that you felt as a result of not going home, like you say, well, it's so obvious, but it's obvious only in retrospect. At the time, it was not obvious because those words of desperation and of immensity were not being used. And we sit with an essential context around us that in a sense normalizes not really talking about it
Starting point is 00:14:38
in those big words or the words of like, everything is changed and I don't know what to do about that or what that means. And then we kind of move forward as best we can, but we're sort of limping forward without really talking about the things that matter, which really starts with how differently we feel about ourselves. That I think we all felt a sense of shame and a sense of responsibility of what should I have seen, what should I have done and you know, he was living at home at the time. So for my parents, their thought of how they could have, would have should have seen something, known something.
Starting point is 00:15:12
That sense of shame drives everyone inside. And now we're trying to communicate and we don't have the words anyway, but we're like muffled. They're trying to communicate while being sort of growled or all of it. And we don't know, like, I don't know the words to say, and I'm driven inside too. And then I think the things that we do often fail to give us what we need.
Starting point is 00:15:33
And then you do see that cascade of trauma, where one suicide follows upon the initial suicide or the people around the person feel so guilty and ashamed that they, their lives had in different directions. I think my mother became depressed and more isolated and it really changed the course of her subsequent life in a way that I think was very negative without any of us really knowing how do we understand this and what do we do about it. And I think that's among the biggest aspects I'm fighting against of saying, look, we need to be able to talk about these things.
Starting point is 00:16:06
Like, what's more important and what's more worth the time and effort to put the right words of understanding to, then what happens inside of us after trauma? You were living in New York, obviously, at the time. I'm guessing this was probably a very significant factor in your decision to take an orthogonal turn in your career towards medicine. But it's interesting that it turned you to medicine, but not necessarily to psychiatry immediately. It would take a few years within medical school to realize that psychiatry became the vehicle through which you wanted to help
Starting point is 00:16:37
someone. I mean, everybody goes to medicine for the same reason. Generally speaking, everybody has some desire to help in one way or another. And then, of course, the purpose of medical school is to figure out the avenue in which you want to do that. What other thoughts did you have as you went to medicine as it pertained to your brother or were there other factors that shaped that as well? I see in retrospect in myself what I often have seen in my clinical work over these past 20 years, which is there's a sort of bifurcation often after
Starting point is 00:17:05
big trauma. And, you know, I had wanted to sort of other things in my life before my brother's death. I wasn't completely happy with my career. And I thought, well, maybe I want more education. And I had a lot of thoughts about that. And the idea of doing those things was really based on some sense of faith and confidence in myself. Like, hey, I could go do that.
Starting point is 00:17:24
I could apply myself. I could learn new things. I could take a different path and figure it out. But after Jonathan's death, there was a bifurcation where I start to feel very differently about myself, to feel incompetent, to feel incapable. I mean, how could I even hope to take care of myself if I couldn't be a brother to my own brother? And my thoughts about myself changed in this way that I now, I write about it in the book and I think about it and talk about a lot,
Starting point is 00:17:55
which was sort of forgetting that I had a sense of confidence in myself. And I was going in a negative direction of becoming less healthy and drinking too much and just just wallowing in my own unhappiness through a sense of guilt and shame over what had happened. And it really came to a point of realizing this is not going well. And I'm sort of forgetting who I've always thought I was. And I got a little bit of therapy, which was a very kind of wild thing to do,
Starting point is 00:18:25
like, you know, no one went to therapy. And there was a sense of stigma even around needing mental health help after my brother's suicide. But even in that little bit of therapy, it helped me ground again to like, like, no, I don't actually feel differently about myself. And if anything, then I felt more of a drive. Like, I want to go do this good thing. And, and yes, it was a drive to help people, but then I felt more of a drive. Like I want to go do this good thing. And yes, it was a drive to help people, but it was really based in a drive of self that am I going to take care of myself in a way that says, if you're not happy and you want more of your life, right? In the way that you see it, are you going to go do that? And that's what I think helping
Starting point is 00:19:00
ourselves and helping others comes together. I mean, if I had no confidence in myself that I could guide my own life or be worth having in anyone else's life, how would I go off and do something to help other people? And I think that's often what we see after tragedy is in a very seductive and evil way, the consequences of trauma beckon us to limit our horizons, to see ourselves in a different and very negative way, which leads to bad things, right? It leads to depression, at least to panic attacks, it leads to substance abuse, it just leads to not being who we want to be. And often juxtaposed to that is seeing the trauma through a lens that makes us redoubled in wanting to be who we can be. And our understanding of trauma, whether it gets the best of us
Starting point is 00:19:48
and the guilt and shame wins the day, and the changes to our memories of who we think we are, is it going to be that or are we going to be lodged into life in a way that lets us move forward? And I was very fortunate to have gone the good path, right, instead of where it could have led me. And going to medical school was, although yes, I wanted to help people, you know, it was about me and my sense of confidence in myself that ultimately wasn't taken away by my brother's suicide,
Starting point is 00:20:18
but man really could have been. When you think back to your residency, you stayed at Stanford after med school for the first part of your residency before going to Harvard. You think back to those first couple of years, what stands out in terms of what you learned and how one teaches psychiatry. Because in some ways, it strikes me as a more difficult discipline to teach than say surgery. In many ways, if I think back to my residency, there's a knowledge base you have to glean and then there's a technical set of things you have to be able to do. And they're relatively easy to mirror, but at least from my vantage point, teaching somebody how to make a psychiatric diagnosis might be less challenging than teaching somebody how to talk to someone and elicit information that would allow you to make that diagnosis or
Starting point is 00:21:10
more importantly communicate with a person in a way to help them. In other words, using words seems harder than using a needle and suture. So what is the process of education in a psychiatric residency program? There's lots of learning of facts, right? Of course, around neurobiology and around medicines and around different modalities of therapy. So I think in that way, it's probably similar to other fields of endeavor, but then there are the less tangible aspects that are the most important, right? How do you establish rapport, right?
Starting point is 00:21:45
How do you really be present with someone? And I think that's where the training in the field, I think across the board often fails us. And I think part of that is sort of the world, the society we live in and the world of modern medicine. I was very, very struck and I can continue to be over these past 20 years, how so much of what I learned, say as a second year psychiatry resident, I think we should be teaching people in elementary school, right? And I really do mean that about just how we respond to the world around us, right? Even the idea that bullying comes from a sense of shame and the person doing the bullying and then creates a sense of shame and inadequacy
Starting point is 00:22:29
and the person on the receiving end. And how does this all work in our brains? And how the logic and emotion clash in our brains and emotion wins over logic yet we're taught that we're logical creatures. Things like that, I was in some sense actually quite incensed at a whole education process that doesn't prepare us to live life by telling us the basics
Starting point is 00:22:52
of what goes on in our brains. So I was very struck by that and also struck that as I was learning it, it wasn't necessarily being directly applied in the field. As mental health has tried to kind of fit itself in with the rest of medicine, it wants to have very clear diagnostic paradigm. So this trend away from describing someone in a narrative. You say, well, how would you diagnose that person? Years ago, it would be in a narrative. You know, you would talk about who that person was and at least a couple of paragraphs. narrative. You would talk about who that person was and at least a couple of paragraphs. And that's by and large, gotten reduced to a number. And in trying to regiment itself, in a way that I think is overly rigid and serves the field's interest and desire to integrate with the rest of medicine, we start losing the truth of really sitting with people and
Starting point is 00:23:42
being present with people. And a lot of what I learned about how to be a psychiatrist was about boundaries with other people, which do in many cases make sense, but the boundaries were put forth in a way that was often about eliminating the realness of presence with someone. And I think that's the part that maybe is the intangible or the harder aspect of the field that I think doesn't really have to be that way. If we realize that we're going to help people through understanding, for really being with someone and trying to understand their experience and of course having it be about the other person, but being a real person with them, that I did find in my training process, but
Starting point is 00:24:21
I didn't find in the field, which is largely moving towards these brief appointments and just giving people medicines instead of trying to understand what's going on with them. A lot of what I often describe as polishing the hood when it's very clear there's something going on in the engine. And while I learned a great deal and I learned from some wonderful people who role modeled for me, how to be with people you were trying to help. It was also a great deal of disappointment with a feel that often in its training and its interaction with patients ignored the crucial point of realness of the experience of the other person.
Starting point is 00:24:56
I want to think about the differences between these two programs you trained in, because you did half of your training at Stanford and half at Harvard, which are generally regarded as two of the finest psychiatry training programs in the country, but they have a very different method of training. So what did you find as you moved across the country for the second half of your training, and how did that impact the way you practice today? Because in some ways you have a luxury of having seen two very different approaches to psychiatry, a more sort of biologic and a more clinical, more of a sort of Freudian view versus a more, I don't know how the way you would describe the one at Stanford, but it seems to me more of a neurobiology view, both of which strike me as having huge benefits if they can be integrated. Was it received that way by you?
Starting point is 00:25:47
I think I didn't understand, certainly not at the beginning, because Stanford is so neurobiology based. So the medical and neurobiological approach to psychiatry is just among the finest points of that program. And I was lucky to learn a lot of neurobiology, neurochemistry, function of medicines, aspects of the different parts of our brain and how they communicate amongst one another to generate our perception of reality. And at times, the problems that can afflict us, I learned a lot about that. But I think I didn't realize how little I was learning of the psychology of being a psychiatrist, of the unconscious motivations in us, of the sort of rich history of understanding
Starting point is 00:26:34
human beings that is so tremendously important to being able to help people. And it was only when I got to Harvard and Dr. Marion Baderaco to whom I'm eternally grateful, I think recognized in me, she was very impressed with the amount of biology knowledge I have and I think that she was kind of horrified with the lack of psychology knowledge and then really helped me to get that knowledge. Once I was there, friend of the people who could really teach it to me and I ended up on the other side of that feeling like I had learned a lot of what I really needed to know. And then the way like I put the rubber to the road of that is by being a real person with the person that you're
Starting point is 00:27:15
trying to help, which I think is the way I approach the field and the people that I work with. We approach the field the same way. But we're really the instrument through which all of that comes and hopefully helps somebody. So that maybe is in one's personality or we just kind of realize that like, oh, when I'm being sort of more rigid in a certain way, like I'm less helpful and if I'm less that way in a more existential therapy approach to realness with the person, then I can use all of what I've learned, the neurobiological and the psychological to really make a difference to someone. And I think that I figured out through practice, right, and through learning what really helps someone,
Starting point is 00:27:57
just like I found my way to trauma. I didn't decide I'm going to be a trauma person. I'm going to write a trauma book. I saw it was undergirding very, very high percentage of everything that I was trying to treat. So the things like that, I think we learned by trying to apply what we know. And I ended up being very fortunate to have had the brain biology knowledge and the psychological knowledge, or that was a little bit distressing to realize when I got to Harvard how little I knew, and I probably wouldn't have known how little I knew unless I had had that experience that really exposed that. When was the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published? I don't know where this fits in the evolution and history of psychiatry.
Starting point is 00:28:42
1948, in late 1940s, I think 1948, but in that range. And as you alluded to earlier, the DSM, as it's abbreviated, is really, at least in part a way to catalog and create crisp diagnoses around psychiatric illness, correct? That's what it has evolved to. In the initial versions of the DSM, it was describing in a sense the phenomenology of like, what is this particular diagnosis like? What are the aspects of it? What's felt or experienced by the person and what's seen from the outside? And then there were sort of clusters of symptoms that would then lead one to think that that
Starting point is 00:29:27
diagnosis fits, which acknowledges, since the unique aspects of human beings, that if we get too rigid about that, we start serving in a sense of the manual, right, instead of the person. And in many ways, the DSM evolved as a way of allowing for research criteria to say, okay, we want to be calling a diagnosis sort of the same thing if we're going to communicate among clinicians and do research, but in my very strong opinion, that has come to a place that now is so overly rigid that you know, you have this very, very thick book that could give everyone multiple diagnoses, right?
Starting point is 00:30:02
It's kind of designed to do that and then come up with a number that justifies the 15-minute appointment in which the person has no hope of actually being understood in any way, because you can't do that in 15 minutes. And we're at the DSM-5 right now, correct? We're in the fifth generation of this manual, which seems to get updated about every 15 or 20 years. Yes, it's the fifth generation, there are technical revisions in between, but it's really evolved to something that I think is so rigid that it in many ways works against the clinical
Starting point is 00:30:35
care that we are trying to achieve. And again, I'm all for criteria and being able to have descriptive language and research criteria, but we've gotten to the point where it often gets called like a Bible, which I think is, is like a very unfortunate word to use in many ways. It implies that there's something in that book that actually tells you what mental health problems are and what they are not. And some of the criteria really make no sense. So for example, someone who has vicarious trauma that they're experiencing, but not in
Starting point is 00:31:08
inocupational framework, doesn't meet criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, which has come to mean like everything trauma. So if you have trauma that's real or legitimate, you have PTSD and if not, you don't, right? Like this clue makes no sense, but the field often views it that way and then applies criteria that are not the be all an end all of the human experience and then becomes very, very rigid in a way that I think trivializes often what's going on with someone and trend towards that symbolism
Starting point is 00:31:41
of capturing everything in a number as opposed to any human experience. And I think we've gone so far away from the realness of human experience and how to sit with a person and be hopeful that the field has in many, many ways led itself very, very far astray. And I think that the evolution of the DSM is both the driving cause of that and also a resultant symptom of that too. Outside of post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD, how often does the word trauma appear in the DSM-5? It appears in other places, but it doesn't appear in a foundational way, right? Because if the book is descriptive, then the book is looking to take an inventory of signs and symptoms. It's not looking at causality.
Starting point is 00:32:32
And that is a problem because so much of the depression that I see, so much of the anxiety spectrum disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, for example, abuse of substances and addiction or alcoholism is undergirded by trauma. Trauma changes that person's experience of life to a place of fear and vulnerability. And then that drives the subsequent problems. But if we're not looking at what's at the root of the things that we're describing, then
Starting point is 00:33:03
we're just taking a descriptive inventory, and that's how we end up polishing the hood. I can't tell you how many people I've seen with very severe substance disorders that haven't been helped by three, four, five, six courses of treatment. And they're then often labeled as quote unquote failing the treatment. And very often the treatment has never taken a trauma inventory. And it is trauma that is driving the substance use. It's trauma that's changed that person's internal dialogue
Starting point is 00:33:33
towards something that's extremely negative, that tells them that they're not worthwhile and they'll never get anywhere in life. And why try for a new job or a new relationship? You know, because you're nothing ever works out for you. And this wasn't that person's belief in themselves before trauma. It's under-girding everything and then it's spinning off these symptoms. Then we take inventory of the symptoms as if they are the be-all and end-all and then
Starting point is 00:33:57
somehow we're surprised when the treatments don't work. The fact that we're not looking to etiology. And I think that's a huge problem. And it fits with not actually paying attention to people that, you know, I would get handoffs that would describe a person in a number like, Oh, who's the patient I'm taking over? That's a 296.44 with a 309.81. And they're like, Oh, my goodness. Right. We're talking about human beings here. but we've somehow reduced that to numbers that indicate a set of symptoms and it's hard for me to see How one could argue the field hasn't been led astray if that's become the standard Let's define trauma as broadly as we can because
Starting point is 00:34:40
There's probably somebody listening to this right now who's thinking Okay, trauma could be an injury. And if they can extrapolate from that and say, well, psychological trauma, we talked about PTSD. I can see how soldier coming back from Fallujah having watched people getting blown up, both civilians and soldiers. I can see how that would be traumatic.
Starting point is 00:35:05
Obviously, the story with your brother. Yep, I can see how that's traumatic, but trauma includes much more than that. So how do you define for somebody who's really hearing about this for the first time, what trauma means? Trauma is anything that pushes our coping skills to and beyond their limits. And then results in a set of feelings inside that could be acute terror, or it could be
Starting point is 00:35:32
for example a chronic sense of denigration, but it creates these feelings inside that then change the functioning of our brain, the communication within our brain, among the various parts, in a way that shifts the lens to which we see ourselves and the world around us. So it pushes our coping skills beyond the limits, and then it changes the ways that our brains function. And that's identifiable in modern science. And we can see the changes in a space-aged neuroimaging that shows how the connectivity in the brain shifts. Or even the fact that trauma changes the expression
Starting point is 00:36:14
of genetically determined characteristics in us because genes are either on or not on, and that changes as a result of trauma and can be passed down to children even years after the trauma occurs. So someone can have the trauma occur, change the brain, and then have a child years later, and the child is impacted by the trauma that occurred years before. So these are real changes inside of us, identifiable by modern science, that happen when our
Starting point is 00:36:43
coping skills are pushed beyond the limits. And our view of trauma comes through this history of seeing trauma through the lens of combat. It's sort of the most obvious way to see it. Like that person went off to war and they experienced terrible things in war and they came back and it's so clear that they are different, right? So that's how we look to acute trauma because it's the most obvious.
Starting point is 00:37:07
And as you said, okay, there's a suicide and gosh, the family members are traumatized. Again, we can see that. But what we pay less attention to and less heat to are two different factors. One, the variables inside of us that determine what pushes our coping skills over the limits differ. It differs by genetic characteristics.
Starting point is 00:37:27
It differs by early life experience. It differs by, for example, how finely tuned one's emotional compass is. It differs by the chronicity of trauma, so the sort of multiple hit hypothesis, which we've seen that if there are multiple traumas, it might be, oh, it's the fifth trauma that now pushes that person into a post-trauma syndrome where the brain is different, even though the fifth trauma might seem less traumatic than the first four, but the weight of the first four are there. So we tend then to paint with this broad brush that ignores the richness of human diversity and how we are impacted differently
Starting point is 00:38:01
by different things. And then it also ignores that not all trauma is acute, that there are traumas that are chronic. So you think of the trauma of neglect. Neglective a child is not defined by an acute incident. It's defined by the impact upon that child of the neglect over time. The same thing with the aspect, for example, of systemic racism, of a person who gets messages over time that they're less than, that they look different, they dress different, they worship different, whatever is going on in them is less than. And that's inculcated into the person over time. And that can have exactly the same effects on the brain. And the same is true with
Starting point is 00:38:41
Ficarious trauma. I mean, we are fortunate, of course, as a species that we can be empathic with one another. We can experience the emotions of another person in a way that's connected as if they're our own. But the other side of that coin is we can be traumatized by what happens to other people. And sometimes that might be someone we're very close to. Or it might be a person who develops such a strong interest because they're sort of horrified by things they see going on around the world, and then are paying very, very close attention in a way that overwhelms that person's brain's ability to cope with with that. And then, you know, for example, a person who was so deeply impacted by the crisis in Syria that then devils post trauma
Starting point is 00:39:26
symptoms. And that person never left their home in the United States, but was so appalled and so distraught by what was going on and didn't know to divert their attention. There was too much attention to something coming from a good place in their heart, but that ultimately leaves that person manifesting the same post trauma signs and symptoms as people who suffer from an acute assault. And whether the DSM likes that or not, it is true.
Starting point is 00:39:56
It's true and it's identifiable in human experience. So the truth of human experience reflects the diversity of how we can be traumatized in acute chronic and vicarious ways, and that how traumatic things impact us, and whether they push our coping skills over the limits, is also unique to each human being, which doesn't mean we don't follow patterns, and of course the discipline of psychiatry following patterns, and identifying patterns is very, very important, but we also need to acknowledge that we are different and we can't understand what's going on inside of a person without paying attention to that actual person.
Starting point is 00:40:35
Using that example, it seems that at the risk of oversimplifying, there are at least two variables at play. There's the individual's susceptibility, and then there's the event or events, which again can be acute, chronic, or experienced by others that you witness. Yeah, maybe circumstances. I always think that as circumstances, right? Because event is still in my mind,
Starting point is 00:40:59
implicitly more acute, as opposed to circumstances, which could be an acute event or something chronic or vicarious. So using that extreme example of a person who, you know, witnessing events in the news, rises to the level of the definition of trauma. Those events, which are not being experienced by this individual over a prolonged period of time, produce the state you describe, which is to say they are pushed beyond their manners of coping and they themselves begin to internalize shame and these feelings we're talking about. So does the DSM look at that and say that's not trauma or it says there's something wrong
Starting point is 00:41:38
with that person because they shouldn't be feeling that way based on that event? they shouldn't be feeling that way based on that event. I think it just excludes them because they just don't meet the criteria for what validates the trauma, which is interesting. So the book has to validate the trauma, right? And that doesn't really make sense. I mean, we should be looking at people and saying, do you present with the signs and symptoms of trauma that has pushed
Starting point is 00:42:05
your coping skills over the limits? Is your mood chronically lower? Is your anxiety chronically higher? Are you having panic attacks you didn't have before? Is your sleep disturbed? Are you more hyper vigilant? Do you feel less safe in the world about maybe yourself or people that you love? Like, these are clearly identifiable things. And if we're taking stock of like, what is your human experience and has something changed in you, then the idea is we would honor that. And I wouldn't say, well, wait a second, that that happened to you, but you were vicariously traumatized in the course of something occupational. So now, okay, so you get, I'm going to put the stamp of approval on you. With that happened to you, but you were just so horrified by what was going on,
Starting point is 00:42:47
say, in Syria that you couldn't take your attention away from it and it woke you up in the middle of the night. And you went on the computer for two more hours. And now, all of a sudden, you really can't sleep well and you're fearful about your children in ways you were, but, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,
Starting point is 00:43:01
what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what Now, you don't get the stamp of approval. The idea is we have to anchor to the truth of human experience because it's not that extreme that people are traumatized by Vicarious things. And I absolutely see this. I mean, I've written many more times than I can count on a prescription, Pallick. I'm going to write your prescription. And the prescription I'm writing is no more news. Because I see that that person's health, or maybe that person I've known for years, their health has really deteriorated over a couple months of paying attention to something so
Starting point is 00:43:30
intensely distressing. And we've had more than we can check a stick out in recent years that you could pay attention to the point of like utter despair. And then who is that person? Like is that person someone who's had three or four really acute traumas, but they don't have a post trauma syndrome, but boy, they're really a setup for it. So they start paying a tense attention to traumatic things they're seeing in, you know, in the world around them. And now they have a syndrome. We're not doing justice to that if we're making a set of criteria that try and treat us like robots or machines instead of, hey, these are human beings, and we have to know, like, what's come before in your life?
Starting point is 00:44:12
Where were you at when you experienced an acute or chronic or vicarious trauma? And if we look at the manifestations, what's going on in a person, and how do we help them understand it, then we can help people. I mean, part of the message of the book is this is not rocket science. There's a lot about this that's very simple and very grounded to common sense, which is pay attention to what's going on in people and help them understand it. And if we have an entire paradigm of helping that's around symptom inventory and putting a label or not putting a label and then schlepping some medicines at someone without really trying to understand.
Starting point is 00:44:46
Then we often, even the first step we take down helping pathways is misguided. And then it is a really a surprise that the mental health treatment system is not serving well the majority of people that it is supposed to serve. And I think it's very clearly true. I don't think this is a overly strong or exaggerated statement that accessing mental health help often leaves someone feeling worse. And I'm not trying to be over critical of the people working in the system. There's so many good people that are trying to help other people, but the system often
Starting point is 00:45:21
doesn't let them do it. I mean, you have panels of more patients and you can count in 15-minute appointments. How are you supposed to understand and help someone? So I think the entire system is misguided towards this. How little money can we spend in the short term? How can we get human beings out of the equation? Because human beings cost more money to deploy than medicines. We are misguiding ourselves in a way that's
Starting point is 00:45:47
away from common sense. And we do often leave people worse than when we found them. A classic example being going to a hospital and trying to get help, where maybe 15 or 20 years ago, when a person I was taking care of might be in crisis, I would think, if I don't send that person to an emergency room, like that would be malpractice. They're in crisis. They need help. Now I have to stop and the vast majority of times I do not do that because I worry or I know for sure if they show up at a hospital, they're going to weigh 36 hours, 40 something hours before they see someone. They're going to be put in a place that's going to feel very shameful and very stigmatizing. There's a locked room and people are watching that person in a way that makes them feel like they're being treated like they're crazy when they're in distress. And when they finally get help, you know, there's some short-term stabilization, give them a
Starting point is 00:46:39
little medicine, they fall asleep, they wake up, they feel a little better because they slept, now send them home. And we're not serving people well with this short-term view of how we're supposed to help them. I mean, they're not enough beds and emergency rooms in mental health units. There's not enough time with practitioners. I mean, the fact that the system is broken is, to me, as obvious as one plus one, is two. I mean, I just see it in front of me day after day. obvious is one plus one is two. I mean, I just see it in front of me day after day. Where in the last 20 years did the matrix come together for you with respect to trauma? I mean, the first time you and I ever spoke about this was four years ago, 2017. And not surprisingly at that time, I didn't really know what you were talking about. I only thought about it in the most literal sense which is
Starting point is 00:47:31
something that is so obviously physically harmful that that could be traumatic But it was clear you had been thinking a lot about this because you had a lot to say on it and you had already been sending patients to inpatient facilities, residential care facilities that specialized in trauma care. So when did this occur for you? When did you start to integrate these other modalities? When was the first time you sent a patient to a residential program that specialized in
Starting point is 00:48:04
trauma such as the bridge to recovery or a place like that? I would have been sending patients to residential facilities for trauma since very early on in my career, but not having the understanding, like, you know, like when you do anything for a long time, like, you know, internalized aspects of doing it that become reflexive, and then it frees up parts of your brain to learn more. And as I got, I think just learn more and I got more experience and more ability to spend more time with people and try and just always have a venue where I could try and understand that person.
Starting point is 00:48:38
Led me to realize, like, wait, I'm doing the same things all the time. If you present to me with panic attacks, you present to me with obsessive compulsive disorder, you present to me with depression, you present to me with addiction, what I'm ultimately doing is the same thing, is I'm trying to help you understand why. Because that's what's going to make the difference, and maybe along the way we can treat symptoms. Maybe I have you on a couple of antidepressants or even someone who has psychosis, something so dramatic that we're trying to decrease that with medicines, but ultimately how to really help that person is to try and understand what their experience is of it, right?
Starting point is 00:49:14
And their sense of vulnerability is of it. And I realized I'm doing this all the time is trying to help people understand where the problems are coming from because that's how they get better, which is the same as what I saw in myself. It was anger, frustration, resentment, underlying depression. Like all of these problems were in me, and a very negative and oppressive internal dialogue. And in my own psychotherapy of exploring this, we weren't trying to treat like what's symptom is it spinning off now, but trying to understand like what's going on inside
Starting point is 00:49:48
of you that you're doing this. And so I saw in my own the process, it was to help me my own psychotherapy and what I was doing with others that it was all about the same thing, which were the roots of what ails us. And those roots are the seeds of trauma falling into a soil that lets those seeds grow and trying to understand what is that soil inside of you. How is it unique to you? How does it follow patterns that impact all of us? What was that seed? How has it grown? I, at some point, realized, oh, that's what I do. That's what I'm doing. And I stopped thinking,
Starting point is 00:50:26
oh, like how many depression cases do I have? How many I didn't think about that. I said, oh, I kind of have all trauma cases. And that was such a revelation. And then in the practicality of starting to do my work more intentionally that way, I could see that it was more effective. It was very, very clear that it was more effective. And then I started working with really great like-minded people and their knowledge and experience with what I was learning like really came together in a way that this lens of trauma seemed not like, oh, some esoteric discovery, but I'm just rooted back to the obvious. It rooted back to the obvious, which it's really some of the older literature and describing human behavior that knew all the time, but just wasn't at
Starting point is 00:51:10
the forefront of the discipline in terms of its education and training. If you had to hazard a guess, what fraction of mental health providers, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, et cetera, have never referred one of their patients to a residential trauma facility. What would be your guess? It's an unknowable thing, of course. Probably a pretty high percentage because trauma gets defined as does that person have PTSD and you know, people aren't going to not going to even sell the things that would
Starting point is 00:51:41
leave them to be diagnosed, right? Because they're ashamed of the symptoms. When you go to one of these facilities and I've been to two of them, the word PTSD almost never comes up. It's usually you have this addiction, you have this maladaptive coping strategy, your angry, your depressed. Let's find out why, let's find out what's underneath the surface. So given that the facilities themselves don't position themselves as PTSD treatment centers necessarily, although there are people there with PTSD, but it's interesting to me that practitioners aren't more aware of this tool. Well, let's take something like an eating disorder. You take care of many patients with eating
Starting point is 00:52:20
disorders. What fraction of those patients would you say have an underlying trauma as a significant contributory factor in their illness? Approaches 100%. Even if you look at trauma through that appropriately broad lens, because we're looking at what causes the outcome. So I'm not trying to look at what factors do I want to be part of it. I'm looking at the actual truth of what causes the outcome. So the the chronic trauma of immensely high expectations of self, right? Often placed
Starting point is 00:52:53
upon self by self, but often that process being aided and abetted by external forces, which sometimes are the expectations of the people around that person or just the expectations of society, of how you're supposed to look and how you're supposed to act and how you're supposed to present yourself to the world and what you're supposed to achieve can create immense senses of insecurity and of vulnerability. And people laboring under that for long periods of time can find an outlet for control. I mean, in many ways, that's often what the signs and symptoms of so many mental health issues are. It's an attempt to find control, and maybe somebody finds control by tapping five times when they think they have a negative thought. Someone else finds control by restricting what they
Starting point is 00:53:35
eat, and they can control what goes into their bodies. And what are the roots of that? The roots of that are always trauma. I can't think of a needing disorder situation, a person suffering from a needing disorder who did not have trauma as a root of that eating disorder with the trauma being discovered and talked about and addressed at least to some degree during the treatment. And that's why the facilities understand this. I mean, it's interesting, the facilities know because when you show up at a trauma facility,
Starting point is 00:54:04
they want to understand and treat your trauma. They're not concerned. Do you have the magic card of entry of PTSD? But because medicine, how many times does this get said so often, but it's true, right? If the doctors are treating the computer, the chart, the paperwork, that like so much of it is about because that person have trauma or not, I got to turn it to have PTSD. It's so busying around with things that don't matter that are about establishing a diagnosis.
Starting point is 00:54:29
So the insurance company will pay for the 15 minute appointment or will pay for the medicine. That's going to treat the symptom, but not the problem, right? That they're then become a gating mechanism. And like PTSD is some magic gating mechanism that doesn't get talked about when you're actually treating trauma because it actually makes no sense as a gating mechanism.
Starting point is 00:54:47
And I think what you're pointing out is very, very powerful that the world we live in says, we have to have PTSD and meet these criteria where you don't have trauma. But what happens if you get to somebody who's treating trauma? They never talk about that. They talk about the reality and truth of what you've lived and what that has done to you in ways that are then counterproductive to your life. And like that's the truth and the realness of it as opposed to a false sense of surety that comes from all those guidelines in box checking that is really divorced from the human experience. It seems to me that part of the problem, I mean, there's so many problems to the recognition
Starting point is 00:55:27
of this. The first is there's medicine works in the sphere of biomarkers and objective measures of illness or disease. So we can look at a biomarker like a person's APOB or LDL cholesterol or a hormone level, and it's subjective. We can understand what that implies or we can look at a CT scan that shows an injury here there. But, you know, psychiatry has none of these things.
Starting point is 00:55:52
Psychiatry, doing an MRI of a person's brain offers you no more insight into their plight or their suffering than rubbing a towel on their head and dumping some hot wax on it. Again, there are exceptions. Of course, there are exceptions where certainly a nutritional deficiency, like a B12 deficiency or something that can show up in a biomarker can explain a psychiatric illness, but for the most part, that's not the case. So I call that kind of macro problem one. I think macro problem two is the heterogeneity of the soil that you describe. You could take 100 individuals and simultaneously
Starting point is 00:56:28
expose them to the same traumatic event. But without knowing what their antecedent history is, what else has this person experienced? So what else has been dropped in the soil? And without knowing the composition of each of their soils, you really have no idea how those 100 people are going to react to an identical stimulus. And that, of course, is very uncomfortable for medicine. When, you know, it's uncomfortable for science. You think of Coke's postulates. We really love it when we can say, of Koch's postulates. We really love it when we can say, add this microbe, get this disease, subtract this microbe, subtract this disease. Like, medicine is so good at that type of thinking.
Starting point is 00:57:14
And again, I'm not saying this to be critical of medicine or to be critical of psychiatry. It's just an observation of maybe this might explain to somebody who's listening to this, who thinks you're out to left field. This is a very hard problem to quantify because of these A, again, the obvious, the lack of biomarkers, etc., the lack of diagnostic criteria, and the incredible heterogeneity of the individual and their history. And those are actually not the same thing. Yes. And anything on the one hand, look, we need to acknowledge that complexity and also that lack of specificity. But on the other hand, there are aspects of that that I think simplify in ways that are
Starting point is 00:57:57
very, very compelling. So in the book, I interview Stephanie Von Gutenberg, who's an expert on understanding and prevention of child abuse and Darren Richter, who's a professor at Stanford, who's done a lot of trauma work and trauma research around the impact of trauma on identifiable markers and what that means. So for example, his work draws at times from the field of epigenetics, which shows that gene expression changes after trauma, and he was his testimony was instrumental in jurisprudence on an international level, recognizing that, for example, rape as a tool of war is not a one-event criminal act,
Starting point is 00:58:40
which was how it was being viewed. Okay, that thing happened on that day. In a way that circumscribes it, and the epigenetic research around trauma shows that not only is it not a one event limited to a day experience, but that it carries on throughout that person's life, it impacts the society in which that person lives, and it gets passed on to the next generation. So now we start having that kind of powerful science that can show that woman who was raped has a child three years later, and the genetics that are expressed in that child
Starting point is 00:59:16
are impacted by the trauma that happened three years, say, before conception. So we do have, in a sense, the scientific proof to hang our hats on these days. We do have that in a sense, the scientific proof to hang our hats on these days. We do have that in a way that tells us, right, we kind of knew all this was true because we saw it obviously in front of us. Now we do have what science wants to have to hang our hats on. And even though, like, say, those hundred people have different soil and will be affected
Starting point is 00:59:41
in different ways, we can understand how that may sort of disperse across those hundred people, right? Like, what is the trauma? A certain number of people, a percentage of people are likely to respond in certain ways if it's a dramatic trauma. Like, if there's some dramatic acute trauma, it might not matter so much what the soil is, people are going to be the majority are going to be very deeply affected. Or there might be other kinds of trauma where you can only understand by really understanding that person. So we do fit patterns and we can understand how those patterns unfold just like we can understand the aspects of basic science that we've learned now in a way that says yes, this is very, very complicated.
Starting point is 01:00:21
That's why it can't be deployed in some check box kind of manner, but we can understand it well enough to say, okay, it's actually not that complicated to try and understand like, what has your experience been or what's going on inside of you, right? If you present as depressed, like, well, what's your history, right, and what are you saying to yourself inside? And has that shifted over time?
Starting point is 01:00:43
Like, we can understand that in a way that says, do I think that your brain is different because of trauma? It's like, it's not that hard to do that. And then to say, well, let's try and understand your trauma so we can help make it better. So there's an aspect of this that's also kind of simple too that we don't deploy because we're lost in the complexity of all those other things, all that box checking.
Starting point is 01:01:04
And we don't know, we don't understand, and psychiatry wants to be like the rest of medicine. And then we get lost in the complexity. And that complexity very often prevents a person from being understood, feeling understood, feeling help, getting any help at all. Are there checklists that provide value? So for example, the adverse childhood event, is that what it's called ACE? It's a series of questions, right? It's 10 questions, 20, how many questions is it? I don't know.
Starting point is 01:01:32
There are different versions that get utilized in different realms, and I'm not. I don't know if the standardized version is now. Yeah, yeah, but it's in that ballpark. So sometimes these tests are really good at catching. They have a high positive predictive value, but they seem to have a low negative predictive value. In other words, there's lots of people who don't score highly on the adverse childhood
Starting point is 01:01:54
event score, but nevertheless there is significant trauma in their lives, but it might only account for one of the 10 checks, but again, for them it was very instrumental in how their identity was formed. So is this something that can be automated or is this something that can only be done by someone who has the ability to dig and really get deep into it? So let's take an example.

Let's take a person who grew up in a family where they simply weren't paid attention to. They would check the box of neglect, but none of the other boxes would get checked. Now, let's say there were multiple kids in that family. Five children neglected because the parents are working like crazy or for whatever reason. Those five kids could completely internalize that
Starting point is 01:02:46
in different ways. Some of those kids could go on to become the most successful people in the world because at least externally, because of a drive that gets instilled in them to prove their worth. One of their siblings could easily go in the exact opposite direction
Starting point is 01:03:03
and turn to a life of substance abuse and addiction. Let's see this all the time, exactly. Let's explore that a little bit more. Because again, there's two things I want to explore there. One, something as innocuous as neglect can produce such vastly different phenotypes. And secondly, the heterogeneity of the soil problem, again, which is, how is it that two siblings, and you and I have both seen scenarios like this, two siblings in the
Starting point is 01:03:32
exact same family exposed to the exact same stimulus or environmental factor, in this case neglect, can have such vastly different responses. And one of them, society frowns upon, and the other one actually society is pretty impressed with. Right. And so you get questions around the heterogeneity of it, or how do we how do we understand it? Well, I think it's both, right? It's how do we explain the heterogeneity? And two, how would both of those people even rise to the level of coming to the lens of trauma given that again, I'm using this very specific example where on an ACE score, neither of them would rise
Starting point is 01:04:09
to the level of concern. Right. Well, we are different even if we are siblings. The genes are different, and their manifestation can be very different based upon aspects of early childhood experience that may have nothing to do with trauma. So I think where it leads us is inventories of signs and symptoms, it can be useful,
Starting point is 01:04:29
but they're just one element of data. I mean, one aspect of it is accuracy of reporting. People will often under report because trauma creates shame in us. I mean, I can't tell you the number of times, say someone comes to care with me and they're checking out, they have depression and panic attacks and say there's some intake form. Then they don't check the trauma box.
Starting point is 01:04:50
Okay. And maybe I meet with them and maybe there is a purely biological depression. It comes out of the blue and I can't find trauma associated with like that happens. It's rare, but it happens more often than not. When you start talking to the person, it's remarkable. Sometimes I have three sessions worth of trauma history. That's intrinsic to all aspects of that person's life, and they check no on the trauma box. Well, because they didn't really think this was trauma, and they really think that was
Starting point is 01:05:18
too long ago to be trauma. And that's not as bad as what other people have to deal with, so that can't be trauma. I mean, this happens all the time. What you just described strikes me as the norm. Right? Is it that? Yes. The majority of people who come into kind of a trauma diagnostic scenario with an astute
Starting point is 01:05:39
provider, but it's the comparisons. Well, I mean, come on, that's what happened to me is not that bad. Look at what happened to so-and-so. The, that can't be trauma. And that was a long time ago. All the time. Absolutely, all the time. Because, and this is really a crux of the messaging of the book,
Starting point is 01:05:58
because trauma changes the instrument that we use to understand our trauma. It's changing our brain. So you combine that with how much shame is a vote. And how hard it can be to discuss that. Because if we're ashamed of something, we don't want to reveal it to somebody else. And we often don't know just because it's a professional. Is that person going to feel okay about me? Are they going to look at me differently because they see that shameful thing in me?
Starting point is 01:06:23
We feel this. And absolutely, I felt this after my brother's death. I'm going to go see this therapist. I don't even know this person. And what you're going to think of me, like, you know, here I wasn't around enough. I only lived two hours away and I wasn't home enough to see this. And like, you know, I thought maybe she was going to say shame on you for what happened. Like I didn't know.
Starting point is 01:06:42
And I think that is the norm, which is why we can't replace humans. We understand this. We can't replace humans in our helping endeavors with something that's computerized or mechanized in some way. Sure, we want to take inventories. If we can, if it makes sense, it takes an inventory of trauma scientists, but realize that you have no idea what that data means until you sit with a person. And why should it be strange to say that human beings are a necessary part of this helping process? Because often, I may look at all the data I have from someone.
Starting point is 01:07:19
And a lot of times I have data, even from other providers or other facilities, or I have a lot of data. I'm like, okay, it tells me something, but I really don't know anything really about that person until they sit in front of me. Because once they sit in front of me, I can anchor that data to something. And very often what I started seeing over getting more experience in the field was when you talk more with the person about what's going on in them, it is indeed linked to trauma, whether they've checked that box or not.
Starting point is 01:07:53
And it's all those barriers. It was too long ago, they feel ashamed of it, that leave them not to recognize that the trauma is driving all of the problems. And I think that the last story in the book about the woman who has a true story, who 10 years later is 10 years younger. And I got her permission before writing it because I didn't, that's not a composite, right? It's this person who just didn't understand like how her life had a tragedy in her life. And it was a years before and just standing from the outside
Starting point is 01:08:28
and hearing the story, there was such a disjunction of how she felt about herself and felt about her life and was living her life that changed after the trauma in a way that was so stark. This is the woman whose daughter died. Yes. Who without realizing it was living this life that was so changed and her thoughts about herself were through such an unfair lens who really had no, despite being intelligent and personable and like all these wonderful qualities, couldn't see it. And like, that's not the exception, that's the norm. And those rationalizations inside of herself, they know it was too long ago, or even feeling so badly about it, that being unable to let it to the surface enough to see
Starting point is 01:09:17
what it was doing had driven all of this change in her. So despite a testing to not having trauma, driven all of this change in her. So despite attesting to not having trauma, it was 100% of it. How did she come into your care? To treat some of the symptoms that had spun off, which is often the case, I go, this person is depressed or, you know, there's so many things,
Starting point is 01:09:35
I'm like, okay, that's just the card of entry, like maybe that I will find they're a pure biological depression. But I have ceased to believe that that is what I will find because 20 years of doing this intensively has taught me differently So then the case the person comes in and I see Whatever the presenting I don't remember right because like that's not where the money was at so to speak where the money was at was in trauma Right, and is this that leaf at the end of the tree that caught the person's attention?
Starting point is 01:10:01
I want that leaf to be a little healthier a little bit better, right? That then brings her in where we look at what's going on in the roots that's affecting all of the leaves. And it then gives us a chance of actually getting at it and developing an understanding of trauma and a reflexive shame and what that does to us and what a change in internal dialogue
Starting point is 01:10:20
from feeling a sense of pride in oneself as someone who works hard and does good things for other people in the world around her to someone who couldn't see her own worth anymore. And you want to see an absolute disjunction of oneself from before and after that will do it. And by understanding it, it could get better. Does it take away the grief? No. In fact, it let her begin to process the grief. Because if we're blaming ourselves, we can't grieve. That's why it can be 50 years later and be just as immediate as when it happened. Because if the grief gets walled off under this layer of shame, like an abscess medically would be in the body, then it can spin off symptoms for years and
Starting point is 01:11:00
years and years without anything ever getting any better. And in fact, with things getting worse because the trauma then brings new trauma. It brings the shame of losing jobs and losing family and all the ways in which feeling bad about ourselves makes us feel worse about ourselves. So it's a great example, but it's not, oh, that's one in a million. It's just a great example of something that I see all the time, which is like, let's get to the truth of what's going on in the person, help them understand it and things get better, and it's not that hard and complicated, but it requires an approach that actually wants
Starting point is 01:11:33
to understand what's going on. I actually have always found the analogy of the abscess to be quite helpful, especially for folks who understand what an abscess is, how it's formed, and what the implications are of it. So for maybe folks who aren't familiar, an abscess is a walled-off infection. So a great example of how one might get an abscess is if they had a ruptured appendicitis. And a ruptured appendicitis carries with it a very high mortality, but there are some ways to survive it without antibiotics without anything.
Starting point is 01:12:07
And this was even known hundreds of years ago when people were making long haul journeys across the ocean. If you had a ruptured appendix in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean when you're halfway between Spain and the Americas, kind of S.O.L. But what they realized was if you put the person on their right side down, tilted, slightly head up, all of the pus that was coming out of that ruptured appendix would at least wall off in the lower part of the right abdomen, as opposed to spread throughout the entire abdomen. And there was at least you'd increase the odds that it would form this fibrous capsule around it that would wall off.
Starting point is 01:12:44
So you'd have all the pus and all the nastiness inside there, but it was sort of walled off. And if you could get this right, that person might just might survive. Now, they weren't going to be perfectly healthy, but they'd survive. Now, today we still see people that show up with abscesses from a ruptured diverticulum or something like that. And they're not well. They're not dead though, but they're just not well. Well, the first thing that has to happen is they have to come into the medical system
Starting point is 01:13:14
for treatment, which I guess the analogue would be here. They have to at least present for help in some way. The second thing is they have to be willing to get help. They have to acknowledge, I have an abscess. Now, it's a lot easier with an abscess because we have a CT scan that is stark. I mean, an abscess is an unmistakable thing. You don't even need to be a radiologist
Starting point is 01:13:38
or even a medical student to spot the abscess on a CT scan. It's the easiest thing to see. Literally, there's nothing easier to see on a CT scan than an abscess. But nevertheless, there's got to be some component of convincing the person that you have this abscess. But what's interesting is the treatment, you often get a little worse before you get better.
Starting point is 01:13:56
Because when you open that abscess and you release all of the bacteria, even though you're doing it in a manner to clean it up, the patient will initially have an inflammatory response to that that is probably worse than the condition that brought them in. Now, of course, you have the luxury of doing this in the hospital. You're giving them antibiotics.
Starting point is 01:14:16
You're giving them IV fluids. You're monitoring them. So this is rarely a fatal event, but it's nevertheless uncomfortable. And in many ways, that just strikes me as a great analogy for what has to happen here, except it's harder in the case of trauma because one, they might be less likely to come in and seek help. Two, you have a really big hurdle to actually convincing the person that you have this abscess, and three, the treatment is much harder.
Starting point is 01:14:46
In many ways, the treatment of the abscess is really quite simple. You're going to be under anesthesia for the next couple of hours and we're going to do all this stuff and we're going to give you a bunch of antibiotics. Well, it's a lot harder to do what you did with that woman than what I would have done with that patient. Yeah, and then as I'm listening to what it makes me want to focus on is the really big hurdle, because I think the abscess is, it's really, it's a remarkably good analogy. It saved you. Your response to the trauma saved your life. Right.
Starting point is 01:15:16
We're built to recoil and protect ourselves from dangerous things, which is why if you think about trauma leading to avoidance and hypervigilance, right? And people become more afraid of the world and less likely to engage and less likely to take chances. Even if it's like the chance of a job that seems better or the chance of getting someone who seems like they could be a great partner, taking chances in good ways. That person becomes much less likely to do that. And if you think about how these systems grew in us, right, that trauma raises a lot of
Starting point is 01:15:47
negative emotion in us, and then we recoil to protect ourselves. And it may be that even a depressed mood or a lot of panic attacks and disturbed sleep. Like this may all go hand in hand with hyper vigilance and avoidance to say, look, that's better than death. And when these systems grew in us where a lot of the trauma that happened did tell you to stay close to home. Human development, right? And we're in small groups.
Starting point is 01:16:13
And if you eat something that makes you sick, like never, never, never eat that again. And or if you go over that hill and someone from another tribe attacks you, like, don't go there again, right? To stay closer to home. They're there for a reason. They're part of the evolution of human beings psychologically, right, over time in order to stay alive. But then in the modern world, those things don't always make sense anymore.
Starting point is 01:16:38
And that walled off, say, psychological abscess that is indeed better than death is spinning off symptom after symptom, right? It's making that tendency towards a little too much alcohol soothing that that person, you know, does a couple times a year. Well, now they want to do it a little more because there's a desperation in them to not feel so terrified or have panic attacks when they're falling asleep. And now they're drinking three, four, five, six, seven days a week or that that tendency towards avoidance is now they can't get out of bed or leave the house.
Starting point is 01:17:07
Like these are things I see all the time. And often what brings a person to care is a symptom, just like the person with the abscess might come to care because they don't know they have an abscess. Exactly, they just don't feel well. So the parallel is so strong there. And I think the difference is in the hurdle. That even though I might say, okay, wait,
Starting point is 01:17:29
I'm gonna feel a little worse before I feel better, but like, oh, I see that bright thing on the CT scan. And you're telling me you're gonna go in and take it out and I'm gonna feel a lot better, not just this thing that brought me in, but 50 more things I didn't know about. I'm much more likely to say yes to that. And the problem, I think, is in how high the hurdle is for trauma.
Starting point is 01:17:50
And I guess actually, I think the problem is twofold. It actually is, and it's not as easy to recognize as the abscess. But I think that it should be that our mental health methods of helping should look for this. In looking for abscesses, we have 256-bit CT scanners that can produce a resolution of one by one by one millimeter. And the analog of what you have in psychiatry to do this is pre-CT scan error when you have to just palpate somebody's belly and surmise that they have an abscess. There's a huge, I mean, I don't want to use the word technology to imply that you will
Starting point is 01:18:29
need technology to do this, but it is effectively the difference between a catapult and a cannon. But I think maybe the beautiful answer to this is in this example we're setting forth, psychiatry is choosing to use the, let's palpate the abdomen instead of the CT scan, right? I completely agree. Yes, yes, yes. Because the human brain has more sophistication than even that finest CT scan, right? So if we apply the trained human brain to say,
Starting point is 01:18:58
look, I wanna try and understand what's actually going on in you instead of saying, oh, oh, you're depressed. You checked all the depression boxes. Let me give you an antidepressant. And I'll see you again in two months and we won't make eye contact. I mean, like, that's not helping. That's not understanding. But if we apply the human brain, like we apply the CT scanner, then we will identify way more trauma and say, look, how many times I tell person, here's the great news is you do not have five problems because people will present
Starting point is 01:19:26
saying, you can't help me. There's no way you're going to help me. There's been going on for years and I have four different problems. How are you going to help me? Here's the great news. We're going on for years because it's never been looked at. So it's not surprising it goes on for years and you don't have four problems. You have one. You don't have depression and sleep disturbance and panic attacks and alcohol abuse as entirely different problems. They're arising from trauma. And I may be why would I be saying that because we've had a couple of conversations where the person told me how none of those things were present before the trauma and all of those things are present after the trauma. And then that's not rocket science. So we could stop palpating the abdomen
Starting point is 01:20:06
and bring in the equivalent of the CT scan or even better, right, the human brain. And then we can identify what's going on and we can also decrease the hurdle. Like, why is it so daunting to get help for trauma, right? I mean, in many ways, it is scary because the person often has been keeping it inside. And I hear this all the time too, like I can't talk about that because then they realize
Starting point is 01:20:29
and often they knew all along, not always, but often they knew all along that that's what was going on because they could tell the whole world inside of me is different now. But look at what it's doing to me and I'm not even talking about it. They don't realize, look at what it's doing to you because you're not talking about it. But when you can get someone to understand that, and often that comes already, that's right there waiting because you're talking at least enough about it that the person has disclosed that there's been some trauma. They put words to something. They may be never put words before. And guess what? The world didn't end. And I didn't lean across the table and say, what?
Starting point is 01:21:07
Like get out of my office. Things that people are afraid of. Like I was afraid after my brother's death. Already there's an ex-people. This happens all the time. I say, I feel better now. I already feel better because literally after just 40 minutes, say, of talking about like, yeah, you know, I really have felt different since that car accident, or even since my, that thing happened to my
Starting point is 01:21:32
friend's child, they know, but because of the shame and the idea of what are you going to do with that? They don't know that there's helping resources. So we don't put it out there that there's helping resources. And people have way too many experiences of going to get help. And then they come out with a prescription for an antidepressant from somebody who didn't really talk to them. And they know that's not going to help, or they've already done it four times, and it hasn't
Starting point is 01:21:53
helped. So we create these barriers by like so many things in modern medicine, by stepping away from, from common sense, like let's use the right helping mechanism. Let's use the equivalent of the CT scan to find the abscess and let's make the barrier lower so the person doesn't have to feel that it's utterly terrifying to go through this helping process. Once people start doing it, even though it's difficult, people feel good about it. They feel good about it, like you feel good about doing something that's hard for you, like you're like working out is really hard, right?
Starting point is 01:22:24
But like you know you're getting healthier so you don't mind going and about doing something that's hard for you, like working out is really hard, right? But you know you're getting healthier, so you don't mind going and doing it, and that's often how the experience is. It's not miserable, and then often surprises people that the clinic, the whole group of us have together, it's not a miserable place to come. And people are often surprised by that, that this is supposed to be miserable,
Starting point is 01:22:42
it's supposed to make them feel bad. And if you come to a place that's just reasonably nice, and you meet people who are like, People are often surprised by that. This is supposed to be miserable. It's supposed to make them feel bad. If you come to a place that's just reasonably nice and you meet people who are like, hey, I'm in the soup with you, too. I know things, I'm trained, that's why I can help you. But I'm fine. But don't you say that in the short term, it can be quite distressing to go back and revisit these things.
Starting point is 01:23:01
I think that's been more my experience than not, both personally and with others, that it really does feel a little bit like that abscess where in the days after that surgery, in that case, the patient actually looks worse. Yeah, absolutely. Like, absolutely yes, but because you know why and you know that it's helping you, it's much more tolerable. And this happens in my own therapy. I'll think, gosh, I've got to talk about something from the past that is now being triggered, right? Like something happens in my present and it links me to a trauma of the past that like
Starting point is 01:23:35
really shook my confidence. And like now my anxiety level is higher. And I know it's going to be hard to go in and talk about that. I know it. And I know it's going to be painful. But I'm not afraid of it because I about that. I know it. I know it's going to be painful, but I'm not afraid of it because I know that it's helping me, just the way that people perceive pain differently in medical settings if they know why. I saw a study you probably have
Starting point is 01:23:54
seen around a gunshot wound, right? And people's pain being so different if they see that there was some reason, right? They're trying to help somebody, right? And I'll they know that even though this is terrifying, they're going to help somebody, right? And now they know that like even though like this is terrifying, like they're gonna survive it, right? And the level of pain goes down. So yes, it's painful, but the perception of the pain is this pain that threatens me, menaces me with destruction.
Starting point is 01:24:14
Or is this pain that although painful is in the service of like doing right by myself? And that's often what we're anchored to. I'm like, look, I don't see a reason for you to have a dialogue running in your head where 500 times a day you tell yourself that you're worthless. Really, that doesn't seem fair or right to me. You know, not even set up your joke.
Starting point is 01:24:35
I don't know if you've been kidnapping buses of school children I don't know about. Like, is this it that this, that there's, like, there's something to feel ashamed about here, but it's the person who did that thing to you. Maybe there's nothing to be ashamed about here because something just happened in life. And it's that change inside the person that gives us all the bravery to go and do difficult things because we see that it's aligned with truth.
Starting point is 01:24:58
And I think often people see psychotherapy as like, oh, we're trying to shift towards something that feels better. Like, that's not the purpose of it. The purpose trying to shift towards something that feels better. Like, that's not the purpose of it. The purpose is to shift towards something that's true. Oh, and by the way, that true thing feels better. What do you think are the impediments to a person once they're presented with a plausible explanation for their symptoms in the roots of trauma?
Starting point is 01:25:24
What are the impediments to them doing the work that's necessary? Because again, here's the second huge difference from the abscess. The abscess, you get to basically put an IV in your arm, take some propa fall, and wake up and have it be over. When you're confronted with these events of your childhood, When you're confronted with these events of your childhood, though seemingly completely disconnected from the problems you're having today as an adult, are probably causally linked. And we need to go back and talk about them. And we need to go back and process them.
Starting point is 01:25:56
And we need to go back and disconnect your shame from those things. There's a lot of resistance that's met there. I mean, last night, over dinner, you and I were talking about common patients whom you get the feeling that they might not take treatment. I think the biggest problem, who says, what are the problems, right? And the biggest problem is presenting to a system that is not looking to throughput and minimal short-term cost as the primary metric
Starting point is 01:26:28
of success. Is that brings the frustration of not finding what's needed? And what's needed, of course, are skills that are learned through education and training, right? They're neurobiological knowledge and pharmacological knowledge and psychotherapeutic modality knowledge, right? But most importantly, it's presenting in a setting where there can be what's called a holding environment. The reason that we can do these things that are very, very frightening is because we establish rapport with someone who we feel and believe wants to help us, is capable of helping us,
Starting point is 01:27:01
doesn't want to look down on us and can help us hold the distress of it. And that's the commonality, like the psychotherapeutic modalities are so very, very different. But if you look at primary predictors of success, it lies in the rapport. Because the rapport, the trust, the mutuality that's generated is what creates that, again, that thing that's called the holding environment, which is like, I'm really, I'm scared of this and it's intimidating, but like, I'm gonna come here, and this is a safe environment, and you're a safe person, and you wanna help me.
Starting point is 01:27:29
And I don't feel bad when I'm sitting across from you, which is why me and most of the people I work with, if not all, acknowledge our own trauma. I mean, we're not talking about it in a way that serves ourselves when we're supposed to be serving someone else, but I'm not pretending that I'm not a person for whom trauma isn't deeply ingrained in my life.
Starting point is 01:27:47
And that sense of mutuality leads a person to feel the trust and to be able to tolerate the distress because they're not tolerating it alone. And when I pack up my trauma at the end of my psychotherapy sessions, I'm going to carry that until the next time I'm going to go back. In part, because the person I go to for therapy makes me feel helped and understood. And I know that he's going to carry it with him. And he wants to help me. And he feels a sense of respectful camaraderie in the work that we're doing. And then I can bear the distress of it. I can take it home with me, even if it causes me some symptoms thereafter, and know that I'm going to come back next week and I'm gonna make more progress.
Starting point is 01:28:25
But our hoping systems have to be set up to do that for people. Let's assume those are in place. Okay, big assumption though, right? Big assumption. But let's assume that that is in place. Why is it that 10 people who have childhood trauma or early life trauma that is producing very maladaptive responses in their lives,
Starting point is 01:28:46
either with respect to self-care, care of others, any of the other manifestations of trauma. What are the things that stand in the way of them accepting that information and moving forward? So first three answers are shame, shame, and more shame. answers are shame, shame, and more shame. Trauma makes a reflexive shame in us, and that's what tells us to make the abscess. What's interesting is in the appendix example, the abscess happens because a biological process happens and now the appendix bursts. And then maybe the body can figure out a way, especially if the person is leaning on the right side, can figure out a way, so that walls off.
Starting point is 01:29:24
But the difference here is like the creation of that abscess occurs inside of us through our defense mechanisms. They say, I've got to wall this off. I can't think about this. I can't talk about this. I didn't want to go to therapy after my brother's death because I was ashamed to go to therapy on top of the shame I felt about his death.
Starting point is 01:29:43
So we do it to ourselves because that's what seems like the course of action that's safest. And that's very, very powerful when we're promoting that process. And then because things aren't going well, we sort of wall off that, it ups us more and more and more
Starting point is 01:29:59
because other shameful things happen. Like after my brother's death, when I was at functioning super well, and I didn't feel like I was taking good care of myself, I felt ashamed of that too, which then makes it harder to get help. So shame, which is like the primary henchmen of trauma, in my view, comes along with all these other accomplices.
Starting point is 01:30:19
Like shame loves alcohol excess. Shame loves an internal dialogue that tells you that you're not worth anything. You're not going to get anywhere, right? There are all these things that shame loves that we then cultivate in ourselves and we apply it to further walling off, further pushing that problem down. And that's why the best route is not just, okay, let's shift how we're handling the care.
Starting point is 01:30:43
So if you go to see someone about whatever your symptom is, that person is actually thinking about you, but we do need, in my very strong belief, to change the sociological aspects of this, to look and say, like, look, many, many, many of us have really significant trauma that has overwhelmed our coping skills, changes how we view about ourselves and the safety of the world around us, and it really behooves us to look at this. And there's no shame in this. I remember this was a bunch of years ago, but I was talking to a group of about 300 physicians from mixed backgrounds, mixed disciplines. And I said this, right? I said that I have that
Starting point is 01:31:20
like really significant trauma in my life. And psychiatric care and psychiatric medicines have really helped me. And I could see out in the audience, like probably about a third or so, is roughest into people like, like shock, like I had said something that was so shameful as if, you know, the next thing that was gonna happen
Starting point is 01:31:39
is like someone's gonna fly through the air and tackle me, right? And you know, pull my medical license out of my pocket and put me someplace where people go who need those things. And I said, look, this is a problem because I can see and I hadn't planned on this. I said, it's a problem because I see a lot of you really recoiling from this, right? And, and I'm saying something that I don't think takes away from my ability to be a competent physician or a competent person in the world. And I think in fact being able to say it is what helps me navigate the world. But if we recoil from like, oh, you might need help, right? Or you might need
Starting point is 01:32:14
medicines like, what is going on inside of us? And that means how likely are any of those doctors to get themselves help? And how likely are there patients to feel comfortable if they broached something traumatic to hear something back that even if the person is not in mental health, right? But just say, wow, okay, look, we know that way more than 50% of complaints to general medical providers come from mental health conditions. I mean, the studies show, you know, a bottom of 50% and a ceiling that's significantly higher than that.
Starting point is 01:32:43
So non mental health providers have to be aware and not respond in this way. And again, I'm not trying to be critical, but you see that response even in mental health. Like some of those people who were choreographed were almost certainly in mental health. And we have to change to so to speak the super swimming in toward the soup that says, like, what do we have? Why should we be ashamed of this? Like, don't we have? Why should we be ashamed of this? Don't we have to acknowledge this?
Starting point is 01:33:06
Otherwise, the negatives inside of us, including the anger and frustration that I think promotes all of the dysfunction in our political discourse, for example, like all of this comes to the fore in sociological ways. If we don't look at this, how likely are we to help people get help? And then if we don't do that, do we make everything worse in our inability to come to even a decision about like what's factual and what's not factual as we all as a society try and navigate things like racial issues or discrimination based upon gender or sexuality or the climate crisis? Like how are we going to look at that if we don't look at what's going on inside of us
Starting point is 01:33:46
that often involves the anger and frustration that make people just say need to be right. And like I'm gonna say, this is always where it goes. A lot of the dysfunction and the misery most of it gets turned inward in people. But some of it does get turned outward and I think we see the manifestations of that in the real degeneration of our
Starting point is 01:34:06
discourse as a society. What is the antidote to shame? The antidote to shame is understanding. And I view the the landing of the abscess or the surgical excision of the abscess. That's the equivalent of shining a light on shame. That shame is so powerful. It's like, you know, the old, it kind of gets told to laugh, but it actually happened when I was a kid like, there was a clothes tree in the room where I made my brother slept. And if you turn the lights off, it could look
Starting point is 01:34:32
like a monster. And like, I know it was a clothes tree, but it's a little kid like it gets scary and is that really a clothes street looks like a monster? It gets scarier and scarier and scarier. And then if I start screaming and crying, my parents come in and turn the light on. Oh, I see that it's just, it's not a monster. That's shame. If we turn our eyes away from it, which is exactly what it tells us to do, you can't share that even with yourself,
Starting point is 01:34:55
let alone with someone you love, let alone someone professional. It's your fault that that happened to you, right? You should have dressed differently. You should have not been in that place. You should have been better and someone wouldn't have hurt you. You should have been different and people wouldn't have treated you so poorly when you were way back when in school. These are the things
Starting point is 01:35:11
that Shane tells us, like the devil on the shoulder telling us why we have to hide it away, and then it gets scarier and scarier. And when we go and shed light on it, they have never worked with one person. I cannot call to my in a single case where shedding light on Shane at all around it, they have never worked with one person. I cannot call to my in a single case, we're shedding light on shame all around it, right? Looking at all the dark corners of it, right? And really bringing it to light in a process that has its moments of fear and misery, but also has its moments of levity and also has its moment of bringing good memories to the four, like being able to shed the light on, light on that has never been anything but extremely helpful to the person doing it. But all the impact of shame tells us not to do that.
Starting point is 01:35:53
And society really kind of goes along with that. And the health systems that want to shuttle us through with a prescription for pro-zac collude in that. So society colludes with shame in preventing way too many of us from ever getting a handle on our trauma when it's actually not rocket science to do so. So if you shine that light on shame and the person now realizes why they feel a certain way, the reason I feel so inadequate is because of these events or this event. And because of this inadequacy, I go and do this other thing. How do you change the feeling?
Starting point is 01:36:35
So step one is understanding why, but then step two, you have to actually change that feeling, don't you? Yes. The answer to that is you work on it across time. We live in a society that so wants rapid results. And that's why we throw medicines at so, so many things and throughout the whole field of medicine that we shouldn't throw medicines at.
Starting point is 01:36:56
Oh, you're not healthy. Well, take this medicine, this medicine, this medicine. We don't tell you how to change your diet, exercise. I mean, things that you understand as well as anyone on the planet, right? We don't do that. So we look to short term fixes. And we all, well, we know through our just even basic education and brain biology that the neurons that fire together, wire together. So if you and I picked a word out of the blue and we decided, let's say it over
Starting point is 01:37:21
500 times. Then of course, like we'll each be saying it like tonight, right? It'll be in our heads tomorrow morning. What if we say that word 5,000 times? It'll be in your head next week. So if we say things to ourselves and we have a way of conceptualizing ourselves that we've overly reinforced, it will not go away overnight. But we don't tell people that. So when a person comes to it, like a really say, an understanding milestone, like, oh my God, the shame, is it mine? Like I was six years old. The shame is that person who hurt me that part of how I make sure we end that session is all those thoughts and the feelings attached to those thoughts and it's the feelings
Starting point is 01:38:01
that make the difference are not going to go away. They will still be there with you because the only way they go away is they attenuate over time. And you've scored a victory today that disempowers them, that when those thoughts come like, oh, you're worth nothing and that was your fault. And if you've been better, that wouldn't have happened to you. Like, okay, you say, wait a second, I don't actually believe that. I can't keep it out of my head, but I'm going to put you back thought, I'm going to direct my thoughts
Starting point is 01:38:28
away from you more quickly. And there's a whole bunch of strategies around that. And then I'm going to put you back a little bit less powerful than how you came. And we don't, as a rule, we do not talk to people in that way. And then people feel terrible. And they feel ashamed. And often, their practitioners think they fail the treatment. And like everyone now looks at this negatively because, oh, two, three, four weeks later, they're not better. There's no way on God's earth, they were going to be better after two, three, four weeks. Like something that's developed over years doesn't go away that quickly. But if we engage in that process and we take away what, the fear, because otherwise if the person feels better, they have this aha moment, and then they go home and they're getting in bed. And the same thought goes,
Starting point is 01:39:09
you know, tomorrow's going to be better than today because you're not worth anything, right? They're like, no, now they feel awful that that thing that happened today doesn't mean anything. So you have to prepare that person it like, absolutely, you can be better, but it's going to take place over time. You don't have to be afraid when those thoughts are still in your mind. I've had people I've worked with who say started their treatment even before I met them. And they had among the most severe repeated negative thoughts and feelings inside of them. And they may have been doing really well for 10, 20 years, but you put them under enough stress and enough triggering and it'll still come in that, oh, you're nothing.
Starting point is 01:39:44
And you should kill yourself. Still comes into their mind. But now they know well enough they will like, wow, that stuff dies hard. There's one person said that stuff dies hard, not afraid of it one little bit because that person understands that he said that to think to himself a hundred thousand times. I guess what it's still going to come back every now then. Does it mean anything? Does it have anything to say to that person?
Starting point is 01:40:03
Doesn't carry one little bit of information. And now that person is in afraid of it. I'm not saying, oh my gosh, am I going to hurt my, they don't, they, they know. But you, we have to educate people and the mental health field doesn't put very much value in what's gets called psycho education. Let's help you understand yourself. And I think that's also a lot of what I do. Psycho education through the lens of understanding trauma. I think if you told me I could only do one thing. Maybe I can't, maybe I can't prescribe medicines anymore. I can't do depth psychotherapy. I can't use multiple modalities. I can only do one thing and I got to choose. I think I would choose psycho education about trauma because then man, you arm people with knowledge
Starting point is 01:40:40
they didn't have before and they can go help themselves, they can get help from people who are close to them, they can maybe get professional help. But it's that knowledge that helps us, even if there's no professional help to be had, which is also a point of the book that I want anyone who picks that book up to be able to read their way through it and to end up on the end of it with knowledge and education they didn't have before because that I think is what is most impactful. And whatever a person does with that, which may be limited by time, circumstances, resources, all sorts of other things, they're now equipped to do something good with it.
Starting point is 01:41:12
And the field generally does not do that. You know, when I think about our practice, I think about all of the dimensions of health span. So when I use the word longevity, I'm referring to two things. Lifespan, how long you live, and health span, how well you live. And within health span, there's really three dimensions. There's a cognitive dimension, which I think most people kind of understand, right? How sharp is their brain? And most people can understand what the extreme loss of that looks like in the form of dementia. Then there's a physical dimension, the structural dimension, your ability to be free of pain,
Starting point is 01:41:44
your ability to carry out activities of daily living dimension, your ability to be free of pain, your ability to carry out activities of daily living, and your ability to do the things that you enjoy doing physically. And then there's an emotional component to this. Even though some people would touchy-feely call this mind-body spirit, I really like to think of it as cognitive, physical, slash, exoskeleton, and emotional. I think it's that emotional bucket that is the hardest one for us in our practice to help patients with because one, we don't have a great set of screening tools. We have
Starting point is 01:42:14
really good screening tools for these other ones. And by the way, on the whole life-span side, we have lots of great screening tools. We have biomarkers and MRI scanners and liquid biopsies and colonoscopies. I mean, we're very good at trying to identify the things that will end your life in a binary fashion from a cardio respiratory standpoint. We're not very good at identifying the things that are going to end your life emotionally. And when my book, which is obviously not written yet, but it's, I mean, it's the draft is there,
Starting point is 01:42:47
but I write about these four types of death. The first one being the one that people think of cardio-respitary, pulmonary death, what I call death certificate death. But then I talk about these three other deaths, cognitive death, the death of the ability of the brain, the decline of the ability of the brain, with respect to processing speed, short-term memory, long-term memory, executive function, the physical or exoskeleton
Starting point is 01:43:11
death or demise, which is basically that which leaves a person in pain and unable to carry out these activities of daily living, and then this emotional death. These three types of other death types, 2, 3, and 4, often proceed one. In some ways, the perfect life would be a long life that just goes straight to type 1 death without detouring through type 2, type 3, and type 4, but tragically, that's almost never the case. And so we think so much about how to identify and treat type 2, type 3 and type 4. But by far the one in which we are the most limited is this identification of type 4. And part of it is, I think shame, there's no question. Part of it is inadequacy of tools.
Starting point is 01:44:00
For example, when it comes to identifying type 2 or type 3, let's use the physical one. We have so many ways that we assess people for movement and strength and balance and stability and stamina and all of these things. And usually, once people are confronted with how bad they are, because almost always relative to our standards through where we want people to be, most people fall woefully short, but they can see, oh this is where I should be. If I subscribe to your ethos that to be a really kick-ass 100-year-old, I need to be a doubly kick-ass 50-year-old. And here are the steps that we're going to take to train to get you there. But I've for years now wanted to think how
Starting point is 01:44:44
could we do that same sort of screening around emotional health? And how would it be received? And how would we then implement therapy? Because really a person who's doing very well on the type one, type two and type three, meaning they have no chronic diseases, they have no acute diseases, their mind is sharp, their body is great, but they're a slave to some shame that's rooted in trauma. They can often have the most miserable life. And really how long they live becomes completely irrelevant. In fact, it almost becomes paradoxically a curse. It's just more time to suffer.
Starting point is 01:45:25
A lot of these people, of course, are not obviously suffering. So it's very easy to see a person living in a crack house with needle tracks in their arm and say, are you suffering? Yes. That's not a huge cognitive leap. But there are no external markers
Starting point is 01:45:43
that we can make that conclusion. With a high degree of. And they're probably self-aware enough. But when you take somebody who's actually quite successful by all the metrics of the external world, they're successful financially, they have a wonderful family, all these other things, it usually takes a bit of prodding for them to acknowledge
Starting point is 01:46:03
and you have to be astute enough to prod and realize that actually all is not well. Yes. So I'm not a psychiatrist. How do I bring our evaluation of what I call type four death or demise up to the level of our ability to evaluate the other three? Those are the first thing I have to say is you've been kind enough to share with me some excerpts from the book and when your book comes out, it will be anything but a day late in a dollar short. And I think you're talking about these aspects of life that are just so, so important in ways that we can understand.
Starting point is 01:46:41
Like, am I taking care of myself in the way I want to? Am I paying attention to my life in the way that I want to? And yes, that emotional aspect of it is the hardest it identifies. You said there aren't serological markers for it, and often the truth of what may be going on is underneath the surface. And I would say that you already do the things there are to do and like we could talk about how might it be formalized But I think of like when you may refer someone to me, right? And like why is that?
Starting point is 01:47:12
I guess I would say this I think we do a better job than most. Mm-hmm I guess what I'm really getting at is Why can't we be doing better? Why is it that there are some patients whom? I suspect there's an issue, but as I broach it, there's complete denial or there's other patients who on the surface will accept it, but then we can't get them to engage in it. Right, the process is that you're going through. So again, what do I think you're doing? You tell me, this makes sense. I think that you're looking for people
Starting point is 01:47:50
whose actual behavioral choices are running counter current to what they're presenting for. And people are presenting to you because they want to be the healthiest they can be. So it's a little bit maybe the health systems are less like that. People are presenting with problems. So you will see if someone presents to you, the reason I'm here is I want to be as healthy as I can be. And then you see that they're not actually behaving that way, right? Or they're behaving in a way to kind of force that. And then that will trigger like, ah, something is going on here, right? Because otherwise, why would those vectors not all be heading in the same direction?
Starting point is 01:48:18
Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity in all of us. So if I would like to be healthy and I come to a health assisting resource, one would presume I'm going to act in ways that assist that resource in assisting me pretty straightforward, right? If we're not acting that way, then it points like there's something going on that's not consistent with that sort of simple, almost common sense understanding of how to make our lives better. And that will point towards something in the mental health spectrum, which the vast majority of times has its roots in trauma. So if you see people running counter-current to their stated goals,
Starting point is 01:48:51
or the second, I think there are two occasions on which we see people coming from your practice. The other might be, if on discussion, the person is sharing something about their inner world that's not consistent with what you're necessarily seeing on the outside. And then their sharing of that dissonance then leads to, there's something going on here that it's affecting them emotionally, even if they are still trying to be healthy, but there's some toll that's taking then under the surface that you want to understand better and guide in the right direction. And the thought would be, we could deploy that in sort of formalized manners in our medical health settings. So the person who really wants to stay alive
Starting point is 01:49:33
because they love their grandkids, but they have diabetes and this is their third hospital admission in two years, right? And you say, okay, like that person doesn't want this to happen, like they like through life. And they have their ground to these reasons of being healthy and staying alive, but they can't act that way. And to look at that and say, like, maybe there are logistical barriers, right?
Starting point is 01:49:55
Like, maybe there are non-trauma-related barriers to them, like, getting to care, taking medicines, like, we can look very hard at that. And then very often, I I think where that process can arrive at is there's something that's preventing that person from taking care of themselves. And then there's the light bulb that says, ah, there's something here for the mental health aspect of helping. Or if an actually talking to someone whose life appears to be going well on the outside, but like, is your inner world consistent with your outer world? And there are ways of formalizing this potentially in your own practice setting, but then in the broader settings of non-mental health helping. So look for vectors that run
Starting point is 01:50:36
counter current to the person's stated and healthy intentions and try and get some assessment of what's going on in the person's inner world because even if things are going well in the outer world, but these problems are there in the inner world, they represent risks for the future. And again, I come back to like, it's not that hard to do, and I think that you're just reflexively doing this, because you're in a sense applying common sense of, in the practice, as if there's something here that seems outside of the fold
Starting point is 01:51:05
I'm operating in that seems mental health, then you make a referral. But the health health systems in our society as a whole can be doing this to help people because it's not that hard to take stock of someone's interstate. If you, you know, if you sit down and talk with them and you establish the right rapport, or to call out when they're acting counter-current with their stated intentions. And a lot of times, the general medical systems kind of push that under the rug because they don't know what to do about it.
Starting point is 01:51:32
So they keep trying to treat the diabetes as best they can with some knowledge in their head that like this lovely person who wants to be healthy isn't really on board with this. But if you don't know what to do about that or the last 10 referrals you've made to mental health, have it yielded anything, three months down the road, the person got a pro-zac prescription and they're no better, then there's a sense of futility to it. And again, I think if we come back to well-grounded, common sense approaches, it's not all that
Starting point is 01:51:58
complicated and it doesn't have to be that esoteric. Do you think there will be a day when shame is out in the open? Because I mean, that's really what this comes down to. You have the stigma of trauma, and then you have the vector of shame that works so effectively at keeping it in the dark. What does a world look like in which the light switch gets turned on, and shame has to retreat to the corner and cower, as opposed to let capes sit over that which needs to be exposed. I think a big part of that is an education process in our societies.
Starting point is 01:52:34
And when you say education, what do you mean? Is this something that occurs in schools? Is this something that occurs in medical schools? Is this something that is for doctors only? I mean, should police be aware of this? I mean, like, how broad a net do you cast? I think you cast a very broad net, and I think it's not that hard to do that. So I think it starts in early education. When you talk about what goes on in people when they feel bad, when something makes them feel good, what happens inside of you, what do you do with that feeling? Help the bully understand why he or she is bullying when we're in first or second grade.
Starting point is 01:53:08
Let's help that person understand and look at that person. How would that be done? I mean, that would require teachers now understanding this, right? Yeah, I think we do educate the professionals. Like we educate the doctors, we educate the teachers. I mean, there's so much that we do in the education processes that I don't think I'm saying, well, there's so much that we do in the education processes that I don't think I'm saying, well, let's bolt on some process that tries to turn everyone into a therapist.
Starting point is 01:53:30
But there's so many things that are done. You think about in medicine, like how many checklists, how much paperwork is done that's utterly and completely non-contributory, and everybody knows it. Why not an approach that's not paperwork intensive or time intensive, right? That just looks at, look, a part of trying to understand somebody is thinking about them through this framing and structuring the mental health resources so that there is a place to send someone. There's a place we're going to have basic conversations about what's going on inside of them that then gates the care.
Starting point is 01:54:01
There are ways we can do this that involve pretty basic education that can change, again, this idea of the whole soup that we're swimming in, where we start with early education, and we run that through educating professionals, educating police, educating legal systems, right? They're mental health courts now. They're not nearly as widespread as they should be, but we are trying to educate doctors in the legal process and the education process, but we're not prioritizing it with a sense of urgency. It can be different, but we've got to look at it and we've got to say, yeah, this is worth paying attention to. Is this what's in large part or in very significant part, driving that we have now over 100,000 drug deaths in this country
Starting point is 01:54:46
over the course of a year. Like, why do we not feel a sense of urgency and want to look at the way that we provide help and to say, does what we're doing that drives doctors to burnout, which is a term that I can't stand. I mean, when I grew up burnout was a negative term to say about somebody, well, they couldn't handle it. And now they're just in a corner smoking cigarettes doing their own thing. Like that was an insult to someone.
Starting point is 01:55:10
And now we level that at doctors who are often traumatized by the health systems that they work in and the unreasonable expectations and that they're treating charts and computers all the time and don't have enough time with their patients. Like, why do we not look at this and say, has this gone mad? That we spend more money than any developed country on healthcare, yet we have the worst outcomes. And we're the worst about things that involve direct contact with humans, preventive aspects of healthcare, treatment over time.
Starting point is 01:55:40
Like, why can't we look at this with a sense of urgency that says, oh, this isn't working. And then I think at the other end, people who other people look to and have a sense of respect for that will talk about their own trauma. As, you know, in some very small way, like I'm trying to do, and you do, and Tim Ferris has done, and even Stephanie German, so Lady Gaga, who is kind to write the forward for the book, that she talks about her humaneness, that we all no matter who we are, are susceptible to this. So from the one end, people who have any power whatsoever, an authority need to not shrink away from this. So if I'm giving a talk to a bunch of doctors, I'm not going
Starting point is 01:56:22
to pretend that I don't have any trauma. So yes, we need, I think have a responsibility to be open and honest about the things that have impacted us if we have any public presence, whatsoever, let alone if a person is a big public presence, if that can be done safely and reasonably for the person, of course, so that's one aspect of it. And the other aspect is the most important,
Starting point is 01:56:44
is on this grassroots level of changing how we frame mental health in the world around us and starting to get us curious about it at very early stages of life. When that bully tells you that you're lousy because of what you look like or where you come from, what does that make you feel? And let's start looking at that reflexive sense of shame. Okay, can you stop and think about that? Like, you feel bad when that happens, and what happens next?
Starting point is 01:57:14
Well, you feel bad about yourself. Okay, let's put a full stop there. That person's hurting you because he feels bad about himself. So, then you start to put a barrier between the reflexive shame and the person feeling bad about themselves because how many people don't actually logically feel bad about themselves, but they do actually feel bad about themselves and it's the feeling that matters not the fact. And we've got to start looking at that because that is the plane and obvious truth that pervades the society around us and we are doing a very poor job of developing understanding in us as individuals at any stage of life and as a society.
Starting point is 01:57:52
And I can't believe that we're not seeing the dysfunction in the social rifts that we're having in the ineffectiveness of the whole of our medical system. These are big, all-encompassing aspects of our society, and we see, hey, these things are not going well. And if we look at the roots of it, I think it's clear where a lot of it is coming from, and also what we can do about it. Which is why I feel the book is ultimately uplifting. I mean, I'm pointing out problems, but I'm not pointing them out in some way of like pointing them out, and then, well, we don't want to do about it. I mean, I'm pointing out solutions that I think are quite simple and well grounded. And if we just follow them through, it's resonating with people because I think it does resonate with common sense.
Starting point is 01:58:33
A moment ago, you alluded to a statistic that I think for many people is just almost impossible to have fathom, which is the United States has just for the first time ever surpassed a 100,000 person mortality for a 12 month period. So 100,000 people have overdosed in the United States for the first time in 12 months. Do you see this as an epidemic of trauma and shame? Or do you see this as really just a new escape valve for it based on the availability of cheap and unfortunately highly potent opioids. I think it's a combination of both and I think the data tells us that that more and more people are feeling desperate and disenfranchised. I'm feeling like look I can't make my way in the world.
Starting point is 01:59:19
Whatever my chosen route of endeavor is, I can't make a living in that. I can't support a family in that. I can't support a family in that. I can't get ahead. I can't feel good about myself. And we see that in aspects of like almost the entire service industry, which has changed to a place where people can't have careers that then support their lives and support a family like was the case even 20, 20, something years ago. We see that even people who have good jobs who feel like,
Starting point is 01:59:46
okay, I finally got my way through work, kind of, I have a good job. That often that job is running them ragged in a way that they can't take care of themselves and they can't take care of their families and they feel the same desperation as the person who doesn't have a job. And this desperation builds anger and frustration and, and all these other symptoms, depression, and panic that spin off of it. And that makes it much more appealing to soothe in the short term. Like that's a basic psychological fact of human beings. The more pain you're in in the short term, the more you're going to choose a short term solution without any consideration to the long term.
Starting point is 02:00:20
I mean, if I'm absolutely desperately miserable and you've got something that can make me better right now, you know, I'm not gonna ask what that may do to me tomorrow. So we have developed a society that has become more and more and more hardhearted towards people's attempts to make their way in the world, right? And I didn't see that with the response to the pandemic of, you know, I'm gonna respond in the way that I want. And I don't really care about you.
Starting point is 02:00:46
And we've seen enough of that, that a cringet times that are inability to even have basic compassion for others, which of course isn't everyone. But I think that's present in society in ways that it wasn't before. And I think it's reflected in the rhetoric and the dialogue that's acceptable, not that long ago, the way people often behave who have a public presence would have led to censure by everyone. That would say, Hey, I don't even care that you're advocating
Starting point is 02:01:15
for what I want or even for me directly. Like, I can't support you if you're going to behave that way, talk that way, denigrate people that way. Like, we've moved far away from that. And we need to look at what are we doing in the world around us? How are we handling ourselves? And are we indirectly promoting this ethic of not really caring that leads to the desperation that leads people to soothe with drugs? There's a very macabre, it's a joke, it's a tragic atrocity, right? That people will say, oh, I'm, you know, I've got to have four people who are drug addicted. In my practice, I'm going to see this afternoon or 10 people, right?
Starting point is 02:02:00
And, you know, it's not who it used to be, right? Because before it was people who'd sifted down to places in society where societies really turned their backs on them, now it's people from all walks of life. And we see that socioeconomic demographic, educational demographic, geographic demographic, racial, religious, ethnic concepts, we've gone beyond that.
Starting point is 02:02:20
Where now we're all menaced by this, because there's often a desperation to sooth that there wasn't that shot through every demographic we have. And if we continue to turn away from that fact, then we continue to look at statistics like that and say, oh my gosh, how horrible. Okay. Right. We don't do anything about it, right? Which is a tacit acceptance of it. If we don't look at what are we doing to people that drives them to desperation, then we're not going to make that statistic better. And how much is going on behind closed doors in the pandemic? How much violence behind closed doors neglect behind closed doors, drug and alcohol abuse
Starting point is 02:02:57
behind closed doors. Are we going to look more at this or are we going to just pay lip service to looking at it while we don't actually change anything. And then we'll be going, oh my gosh, it's so terrible. It's three years for now that number's 140,000. Well, if we don't really care now as a society, we just want to marvel at the number and say, how bad it is and do nothing, well, it's exactly where we're going to go. That's why the number has been increasing, right? I mean, it's not rocket science to say that either. You just extrapolate that line ahead and that gets worse and not better unless we look at it in a way where we accept, like, we got to do something different because this is staggering in the human misery that it speaks to, not just 100,000 people lost, not just.
Starting point is 02:03:39
I mean, what are all the people who love those 100,000 people? Like, what are we doing? Which is why when people would say, oh, like sometimes I'll get approached like, I'm in a, I'm doing something that's very niche. Like, I'm interested in trauma, right? And I say, no, this is not a niche, right? This, you get up to numbers like that.
Starting point is 02:03:56
There's a cascade through the population. And it doesn't have to be like this that our burdens of trauma just grow and grow and grow. We should be appalled by that number, appalled enough to do something about it. Paul, a lot of times we treat people based on the symptom of their trauma or we at least categorize them that way. And this is even within the lens of helping people and acknowledging their trauma. So for example, addiction is a very common manifestation of trauma. And the most obvious of those, or at least the one that probably gets most people's attention,
Starting point is 02:04:33
would be substance addiction, alcohol or drugs. But there's work addiction, there's process addiction, there's gambling addiction, there's sex addiction, there are actually lots of other types of addictions. But we could bucket those as addictions. There's codependencies, there's anger, perfectionism, other means of control. We talked about eating disorders. It seems that one way to think about this is treating people together who have similar end states. So you go to a 12 step meeting because if it's AA, it's people with alcohol, if it's Alonon, it's family members of people
Starting point is 02:05:14
with alcohol, if it's NA, it's narcotics, if it's SA, et cetera, it's sex. Has anyone ever thought about doing the opposite? Which is rather than take everybody whose issue is alcohol addiction and having them come to a meeting, which by the way, I'm not advocating against, what if we bundled people together through the common lens of what the trauma was? Is that something that's ever been thought about and would that be more or less efficacious than the current approach?
Starting point is 02:05:39
In other words, you have a meeting which has lots of people in it who have very different manifestations of their trauma. You're going to have someone who's addicted to alcohol, someone who's a workaholic, someone who's a rageaholic, someone who's a completely codependent, someone who's got debilitating anxiety, someone who's got debilitating depression. But what they all have in common is they were completely neglected by their parents. That's their common theory. Would there be any advantage to doing that,
Starting point is 02:06:05
or is it better the way we typically think of doing it? Yeah, I think there's a huge advantage to that. And when at one point I was medical director for a clinic, we had programs running for helping groups. By and large it was all around substances, but I wouldn't separate it by what the substance was I think we even get that fun now we're gonna separate by what the substance is alcohol versus narcotics right and and even at that level Let alone at the higher levels of this person is angry this person is addicted to unhealthy foods
Starting point is 02:06:40
There's so many ways in which the the addictive processes can take hold of our brains in order to provide some short-term sense of control or short-term relief from the desperation of feeling out of control. And when we parse that out too much, then again, we're just trying to check boxes and we're telling that person that what you have, this thing that is innocent to your burden to carry, is so much about you, right? The ramen alcoholic and I'm a rage a holic.
Starting point is 02:07:09
And just the very language we use about that is often so stigmatizing. That's the thing that's bad about you. That's often the message. Again, not always, but that's often the message that it sends as opposed to like none of us comes out of the womb, an alcoholic or a rage a holic or addicted to unhealthy food. They have like, look, what's happened to us along the way that leads us to this place and that's how we make a search for commonality. So we have a set of processes that want to further parse things out, right?
Starting point is 02:07:39
We're so overly reductionist that oftentimes we would see where the person who was in alcoholic would feel like, why don't want to sit in a room with the person who's addicted to cocaine? As if there's like nothing in common as opposed to like, yeah, what's what is in common? Because I knew the health histories of those people, right? Because I was the medical director of the clinic. And I would say, wait, what is 80% commonality as a driving force amongst everybody is trauma. And that's just here, if you step further back, you see that across the things that we get short-term relief from at the expense of our long-term health. And the over reductionism, I think, is a
Starting point is 02:08:19
facet of wanting to just put things in little buckets and then gaining some satisfaction from that. But now, okay, now all it is is in a bucket and actually being in that much of a bucket. You know, like a marble that goes down, right, is like, now you can't get to it or you can't get to what's real about it instead of like, yeah, what's going on in a lot of people, say, at least is trauma.
Starting point is 02:08:39
Can we put those people together and look at trauma, which ironically is what the real sophisticated helping resources around trauma are doing. I mean, that's often what say the bridge to recovery is doing. It's looking at like, hey, what is your trauma? Now, okay, now let's go forward from there. But that's because they're bringing a sophistication to it and people who do that work just reflexively know that.
Starting point is 02:09:02
They know that that that's not different. You can look at people who are addicted to one thing versus another and you're not finding massive differences between them and you know the aspects of the science of it all catching up with it shows that. It's hijacking the same machinery in the brain and you know you can't tell the difference like one substance looks different from another in the brain or one thing a person is addicted to for relief of distress So it's like we know all of it But we have these entrenched ways of looking at it through the lens of of how medical care is or how society views it
Starting point is 02:09:35
And we're so far beyond the science and I will say this is a fair amount that if you're in a Very well-defined field of medicine. I say cardiology or so, we kind of know how to assess people, how to understand people, there's a lot of data behind the interventions. If you're practicing, even just a couple of years ago, like, that's not okay and one will identify that and that's not okay, right? We'll have to change that. But in mental health, the practice within individual practitioners and the systems can be antiquated by a half a century.
Starting point is 02:10:07
Or a couple thousand years in some cases, and we don't come in and look at that. There are programs that are taking care of people for opiate dependence that don't even talk to them about a medicine that you can get a shot of that prevents you from overdosing when you leave. And it's somehow okay not to even talk about that because we let all of this lag behind. And yes, part of it is, I think how the field has handled it and the science isn't as well developed, but it's not like there's no science and it's not like there's no obvious ness to what we could be doing that we're just simply not doing.
Starting point is 02:10:45
And I think a big part of that is the stigma, the shame, that we don't want to come in and look at all of it, and say there's an obvious here that we're just not paying attention to, because if the shame is shot through humans, then it is also shot through the humans who are making those decisions around resource allocation, and how do we approach the helping process? Changing gears for a second, Paul, the final thing I want to ask you about is the role of two substances in particular, psilocybin and MDMA, both of which I've talked about in
Starting point is 02:11:17
previous podcasts as they pertain to trauma. I'm curious as to what your experiences with this and maybe more importantly, what is your optimism around these two molecules, both of which are really moving quite along a pathway towards a clinical approval, a legalization for clinical use. In the case of MDMA, it is foreign-fact PTSD. So kind of curious as to whether you see that as an amazing adjunct to what we're talking about or a slight adjunct or potentially less. I see it as among the brightest sort of shining hopes
Starting point is 02:11:58
for the future. And I think the data, both from decades ago and the more recent data and the clinical experience in trials and the firsthand reports, I tell us things that are so incredibly powerful. And that fit with a lot of what we've thought about and understood about brain biology and about psychology, right? There's a way in which it provides so much greater potential for understanding and helping. And of course, the process is in place so that these very, very powerful tools can be understood and deployed safely and effectively. And in the context of all of
Starting point is 02:12:38
that, I think that the hope is immense. And a story I'll tell sometimes to try to capture that is where I grew up was close to the Delaware Raritan Canal, it ate on colonial times, it ran between New York and Philadelphia, it was part of a network. And I was always fascinated that artifacts would be found. There's somebody to be fishing in Find a Vase or something, right? And it's like a maze. These barges went up and down, I'm like, what's in there? And people would find things and that was interesting. But then at some point in time, they drained a whole section of it too. And when the section was drained, my goodness, what they found and what they saw, right? And it's the same kind of analogy that I think the helping powers of these substances are so strong that they can get us to places of really seeing what's going
Starting point is 02:13:27
on inside of us and shifting how those brain pathways which have been so changed. And again, the science tells us this, this is not esoteric. We have more science that is similar to what the CAT scan can do for the appendix to see that being able to do that with these helping modalities allows for understanding and is so predisposes to and is permissive of change in ways that can let people reorient much, much faster. So I think there's a potential here for even a revolution within the field, but we have to safely and effectively incorporate those arrows
Starting point is 02:14:06
into the quiver. And then we see, of course, what is often seen, which is many of the people or organizations wielding that have the magic amulet of like, I am the source of the helping resources don't like this. So we see some aspects of traditional psychiatric care that don't like this. And I think that's the sense of threat that I think the power of these resources make a lot of the tools that I wield seem maybe a little bit pottery in comparison. Now, that's not always the case.
Starting point is 02:14:37
And if that is the case, wonderful, right? There are new, powerful tools coming to the fore. We need to approach it, those of us in Western medicine, through a lens of being respectful of what that is and wanting to understand the new modalities and approaching it from a lens that says, look, if I'm going to help people, and I'm going to hold myself forth as knowing how to do so, then I better know what all the arrows and the quiver are and understand them enough that I can either deploy them or I can understand who can deploy them in a way that does justice
Starting point is 02:15:11
to the person coming in the door. If I'm coming in the door for help, I don't care what it is. I want the person who's going to help me and have all the possible arrows in their quiver. And I think we can get to a place of incorporating this. But again, society and the helping systems have to bend a little bit to acknowledge the incredible potential. And then we work towards integrating instead of splitting. And like, we're in a societal mode in this country that's very much splitting, whether it's sociological, it's political, even medical, right? Again, I come back to the basic theme of, I think it's trauma
Starting point is 02:15:46
that leads us to reject new helping resources because they may be threatening to our power within a discipline. And that by re-grounding to really the first principles of knowledge and of helping, then I think we again come back to an urgency to ground ourselves to the basic common sense of understanding everything that we help full and having all of those arrows in the quiver of health systems or of, to the extent possible individual practitioners. Paul, as always, it's great to sit down with you, especially in a case like this where it's not just me you're talking to, but so many other people who I suspect will really
Starting point is 02:16:21
benefit from this. Tell people again the title of your book and other places they can look to find resources. Sure. So the title of the book is trauma, the invisible epidemic. And you can find it if you just Google me, Paul Conti or the clinic I work in, which is specific premier group.
Starting point is 02:16:37
You'll come up with links that talk a little bit about the book or the principles contained therein. And there's so many good helping resources around. NAMI is one of them. And sorry, is that NAMI? What's that? So NAMI. Okay.
Starting point is 02:16:52
And so a great access to resources often on a local level. There's so much help to be had. And some of that help we can access in our own homes. We can access to people that we love and who love us. We can access by thinking about what's and who love us. We can access by thinking about what's going on inside of us and others. And I think that's such a part of the message that I want to deliver, that it isn't esoteric. And if we ground to what's really going on inside of us and paying attention to it, and it is sense being brave enough to face it because we
Starting point is 02:17:22
see hope in facing it, that we can begin a process of really helping ourselves and others. And I've just seen that unfold so, so many times, including in my self that I really believe in it. And I'm so glad that we've had this conversation that that is about some of the real big picture of it and the more kind of rarified medical aspects of it. And I think a real understanding of it runs the whole gamut, but is ground in that simplicity of what's really needed and what's important to help ourselves and to help other people. And I so appreciate you having me on and having such a good friend who's also such a good colleague and helps this discussion unfold in a way that really helps get the message out there because we all need the message.
