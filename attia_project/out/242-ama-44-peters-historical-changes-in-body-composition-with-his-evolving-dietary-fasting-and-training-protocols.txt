Hey everyone, welcome to a sneak peek, ask me anything, or AMA episode of the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. At the end of this short episode, I'll explain how you can access the AMA episodes in full, along with a ton of other membership benefits we've created. Or you can learn more now by going to PeterittiaMD.com forward slash subscribe. So without further delay, here's today's sneak peek of the Ask Me Anything episode. Welcome to AMA number 44 and once again, joined by Nick Stenson. In today's episode, we do something a little bit different. I recently had a Dexascan and some blood work done. And I decided that we would go back and look at the past,
Starting point is 00:00:55
I don't know, 10 to 12 years of my Dexascan results through a variety of changes that I've made, but specifically with respect to nutrition and exercise. So we focus really on how my nutrition and exercise has changed over the past 12 years and how that has impacted at least one metric for the purpose of this discussion, which is body composition. So as our subscribers, you have told us that you find great value in patient case studies and we figured for this time, let's use Peter as the patient.
Starting point is 00:01:21
So when this AMA, we go through my DEXA reports for the past 12 years or so, along with my most recent blood test, and we talk about all of the changes that have taken place. So when I went into ketosis for a prolonged period of time, came out of ketosis, spent a lot of time doing time-restricted feeding, spent a lot of time doing periodic prolonged fasts, high protein, low protein, all sorts of things. I also talk about the evolution of my training when I was primarily an endurance athlete versus now when I'm primarily strength training, but obviously still doing what I consider an appropriate amount of endurance training.
Starting point is 00:01:56
So while this is a bit of a different episode, my hope is that you'll find a lot of insight in here because even though we're using me as a case study, a lot of what I talk about is I believe applicable to all of you because I know it's applicable to all of my patients. These are the types of discussions that I have with my patients every day as we review their dexascans and of course, their blood work. Now, if you're a subscriber and you want to watch the full video of this podcast, which is actually going to be pretty helpful because we are showing a lot of the images and the percentiles of changes in things like body fat, visceral
Starting point is 00:02:29
fat, ALMI, FFMI, those sorts of things. By all means, make sure you check out the video of this podcast, which you can find in the show notes page. If you're not a subscriber, you can watch a sneak peek of the video on our YouTube page. So without further delay, I hope you enjoy AMA number 44. Get it? Welcome to another AMA. How you doing? Doing well, but you look awfully cold. It is negative degrees right now. It's not good. It's that time of year. I feel like we've got nothing but snow for the past two weeks. So it's just a matter of survival at this point. There's nothing you can do.
Starting point is 00:03:07
I mean, I know you miss it. And that's kind of why you want to go back to Canada. It's just the weather. So it's fair, but you can always come to Minnesota, can come live out here. I think the whole time I was growing up in Canada, I kept wondering why did people live there prior to the industrial age, like prior to heat
Starting point is 00:03:23
and things like that? Like did it not occur to them that, hey, I could just walk south for a couple of months, and I'll be in a place where yeah, it's hotter in the summer, but like I don't risk dying in the winter anyway. Well, on that note, we're going to do a little something different for this AMA. We kind of had a little something else planned. And then recently in the past week, you've gotten some labs and Dexter results back. And you found something else planned. And then recently in the past week, you've gotten some labs and dexer results back and you found them really interesting. And we were talking about them internally.
Starting point is 00:03:51
So we kind of decided to pull an audible and instead kind of talk through those because I think what we've heard from our audiences, whenever we can do case studies and see like real-world results and then how people tweak it, they've always found that really helpful. And this time the patient's gonna be you.
Starting point is 00:04:07
So hopefully it's even more interesting and on the cold, which we'll get to in a second, I think the rate you're going, you could survive in the cold a lot longer than you maybe could have 10 years ago. Ouch, ouch. That's it. I think what we're gonna do is
Starting point is 00:04:22
we're just gonna kinda get into it. It's gonna be a little more old school kind of question and answer and going along the way. But I think what would be helpful is a few AMAs ago, I'm a handful probably at this point, we talked about DexA and we went through kind of how you think about that and then also what you do with patients. And so what you have is you have a spreadsheet of DexA's that you've done over the past 11 years and kind of how your body has changed throughout that time. And I think what we'll do is we'll use that as an anchor to talk about like the various things
Starting point is 00:04:54
and what you've seen from yours. Because I know in that time you've done a lot of different things from exercise to nutrition to everything else. And I think it will be a good point to walk through that. So do you want to just share your screen, kind of pull up those? Before I do that, I'll just kind of give a bit of the background. So growing up, when my main thing was boxing, obviously, weight, that's a very, very weight driven sport, especially if you're not a heavyweight,
Starting point is 00:05:22
which I was not, I was a middleweight, every ounce of non-essential tissue you carry into the ring is problematic. So, we relied on calipers at that time for body composition, and as anybody who's either had a caliper test done, or certainly done one or seen it, understands it's not the most objective standard, and it's highly dependent on the skill of the individual doing the test. That said, a person who really knows what they're doing with calipers is awfully good and pretty accurate. Fast forward to my 30s, the next time I was paying attention to this sort of thing,
Starting point is 00:05:59
that's when I was doing hydrostatic testing. So you would go to places that weighed you while dry and then weighed you underwater under the conditions of full exhalation and the ratio of those two weights, your buoyant weight versus your knot and the use of Archimedes principle would basically allow them to deduce
Starting point is 00:06:21
how much of your weight was fat. I do not be a pretty inaccurate way to go about doing things, because again, if for no other issue, highly dependent on basically how much air is left in your lungs at the point of exhalation. So I think it was probably 2011, so almost 12 years ago, I sort of switched over to Dexas scanning, and for all intents and purposes,
Starting point is 00:06:42
Dexas is the gold standard. And we've talked about what that is, so I'm not going to go into it, but basically it's a type of X-ray that scans your body, that effectively divides tissue into the following buckets, very accurately, bone, fat, other. So the other is mostly muscle, but of course course it's also your organs and things like that. So we look at dexas in a number of ways. It's very good at giving total body fat because it's very accurate at measuring fat. So total body fat divided by total body weight is your
Starting point is 00:07:22
body fat percentage. And as we've talked about, that's the thing that most people care about when they get a dexascant. When our patients get dexascans, and we are really adamant that our patients get dexascans at least once a year. I think this is a very important thing to be doing. When I run through the results with them,
Starting point is 00:07:40
I always say the same thing. Of the four things we're gonna talk about today, the least interesting of these is your body fat. The three other things that we talk about are your visceral fat, which is one of the compartments of fat that is outside of the subcutaneous stores. That's the areas where we want to store fat. If we're going to put excess energy away,
Starting point is 00:08:00
we want it to be in subcutaneous pockets of fat. As our capacity to store fat there gets stretched, we begin to spill over into other places. We talk about this and I write about this in the book as the bathtub. So everybody has sort of a different size bathtub. That's their genetic capacity to store fat in the safe subcutaneous space. The water coming in the bathtub is what you're eating. The water leaving a bathtub through the drain is the energy expenditure. You will either be net accumulating
Starting point is 00:08:29
or net losing water in that bathtub. But if you get at the point where you exceed your bathtub's capacity to hold water and you start to spill over, really bad things happen. Nobody likes to have even a small amount of water on their floors and God forbid in their drains and heating ducts. And that's what's basically happening when you start to see visceral fat,
Starting point is 00:08:47
when you start to see intra-hepatic fat, you know, nafflede is the earliest stage of that. When you start to see peripanchreatic fat, perinephric fat, pericardial fat, all of these things are really problematic, highly inflammatory, and effectively what I would call the fourth pillar of disease. So for example, if you're talking about AACVD, we talk a lot about apob, blood pressure smoking, we don't want to forget the inflammatory effect of those fat sources.
Starting point is 00:09:18
So that becomes the second thing we care a lot about. Third thing we care a lot about is bone mineral density. So we care about a person's Third thing we care a lot about is bone mineral density. So we care about a person's Z scores and T scores. Recall from the podcast we did on that. The Z score is your age sex matched BMD for your lumbar spine and your hips. The T score is comparing you to a 30-year old. We use the T score to make the diagnosis of osteopenia. If that's one standard deviation below the mean or osteoporosis, if you're, I believe, two and a half standard deviations below the mean. The fourth thing we look at are the metrics, the two metrics of muscle mass, which are
Starting point is 00:09:56
ALMI and FFMI, appindicular lean mass index and fat free mass index. These are two different methods to triangulate on the same sort of thing, which is basically how much muscle mass do you have for your height. So the ALMI is calculated by looking at the lean mass in your arms and legs and kilograms, dividing that by your height and meter squared. The FFMI takes the total fat free mass in your body and divides that by your height
Starting point is 00:10:27
and meter squared. Obviously, FFMI is a much bigger number than ALMI. The absolute number is aren't what matters. What matters is where do you show up on the NOMAGRIM for your age and your sex? And we want our patients to be north of the 75th percentile for ALMI and FFMI based on the data we've shared previously. Okay, so with all that said, I have kept a spread gene for the NOMAGRIM. to be north of the 75th percentile for ALMI and FFMI based on the data we've shared previously. Okay, so with all that said, I have kept this spreadsheet for better part of 12 years, where I log my DexA data, and it'll be interesting to go through some of that now.
Starting point is 00:10:58
So again, let me just set the context because I think what we'll do when we go through this, so people that are just listening to this, I think I'll do my best and Nick, you'll do your best. We'll try to talk about the numbers. But the reality is, this is one of those things where it's probably helpful to be watching a screen when we talk about this stuff. We're going to kind of talk about what was happening in my life at each of these time points. How did things change? Because really there's a bunch of variables. There's the passage of time more than a decade. There's many changes in nutrition from very strict types of diets to fasting to completely unrestricted eating. And then obviously there's dramatic changes in the type of exercise that's been going on there. Those are really the
Starting point is 00:11:36
fundamental three changes. Anything else before we jump into this? One thing I was going to say is I think anyone listening won't be surprised that you keep a spreadsheet of data of like across different health metrics. And it's something that you do beyond just DexA, but I've heard you talk a lot about it and I know with patients internally you create kind of a trend sheet, which is like let's do a lot of work to upfront get all their historical labs. So then we can see how does this number compare historically as opposed to looking at this number isolating. And so as much of a pain as it is for people, whether it's DexA or even labs, you put a high value in being able to look at something like this where you can say, let's look at historically,
Starting point is 00:12:24
let's monitor changes as opposed to like, I got a DexA, I'm just going to look at something like this where you can say, let's look at historically, let's monitor changes, as opposed to like, I got a Dex, I'm just gonna look at it this time, I got my blood run, let me look at what it is now, and then not focus on everything else, correct? Yeah, and there are companies that do this kind of stuff. I mean, we kind of build our templates in-house. I'm not, I guess, later I'll show our in-house template
Starting point is 00:12:43
for how we present the data, and then if obviously you just have a table that records the historical data. So you present the current data in graphical form and then include that along with all the historical data in tabular form so you can see the trends. But yes, I think trends matter. You're treating what you see,
Starting point is 00:13:01
but you're mindful of the trends. Okay, so let me do a little screen share here and pull up the DexA data. So what you're looking at here is a relatively straightforward spreadsheet that simply records the data as they've been laid out going back to May of 2011. What's interesting is that was the first Dexas can I ever had and I did it the same day that I had a hydrostatic dunk test. So I had been maybe every year doing a hydrostatic dunk test and on that particular day, and maybe it was the day before, but it was pretty, I think it was the same day. I had a hydrostatic dunk test and it said something like 16% body fat.
Starting point is 00:13:47
And I was like, well, I sure don't look like I'm 16% body fat. And then I decided to go and splurge for the Dexack because at the time, and there probably is still a significant difference in price. So I went at the Dexack and it was like, no, you're actually 9.3%, which was kind of more in line with what I felt like I was. And that was basically the last time I did a hydrostatic test. Now, why again was there's such a discordance between them? I don't know. Maybe I'm someone who can't get a lot of air out of his lungs, and therefore wasn't giving a good enough underwater weight relative to above water weight. But regardless,
Starting point is 00:14:20
that's where I was. Call it that 12 years ago. So as you can see, just to orient you to the columns, body weight at the time was just under 180 pounds. And then what's being spit out is what the Dexascan is really good at telling you. It's able to tell you how much lean mass you have. So that's basically muscle and organs, call it 156 pounds, how much fat mass, 16.8 pounds, the mass of bone mineral content, seven pounds, and then fat free mass, which is, you can see,
Starting point is 00:14:53
it's just the sum of lean mass and bone mineral content, 163 pounds. So body fat is calculated at 9.3%. Now, unfortunately, this was back when I lived in San Diego, and I was doing these at San Diego State University or something, and they just didn't have the software at the time. They weren't spitting out that. So I don't have that recordings. Furthermore, they probably gave segmental information on their reports, but I wasn't paying attention to it. So when I, you know, a couple of years I wasn't paying attention to it. When I, a couple of years ago, started paying attention to ALMI and FFMI didn't have the data. I even called them up and they didn't have the reports. Back then, all I could tell you was what my fat mass index was. Again, I don't really pay that much attention
Starting point is 00:15:41
to that metric, but I do record it. And what my fat free mass index was, and we'll talk about that, but I don't have ALMI until 2014. Okay, so what can I say looking at those numbers? So a body fat of 9% and I would have been 38 years old. So I'm gonna pull up my table of what that is. So that's low, right? That's sort of below the third percentile. So that's really lean. And for an FFMI of 23.4 at that age, it's above the 97th percentile. That's the highest line on the nomogram.
Starting point is 00:16:26
So what was I doing at the time? I guess that's the more important question. So that's back in an era where I was swimming a lot and that was kind of my main thing, like pool swimming. I was kind of done with open water marathon swimming. I was lifting weights like crazy and doing a little bit of cycling as kind of cross training. And I was on a carb restricted diet, but not a ketogenic diet.
Starting point is 00:16:55
So this was right before I started a ketogenic diet. In fact, this is the month I went on a ketogenic diet was May of 2011. So I was pretty carb restricted for a year before that. Okay, so fast forward to the end of that summer. I'm now, I don't know whatever, two, three months into a ketogenic diet. I go and repeat the test of lost weight. So I've gone from 180 pounds down to call it 172 and a half pounds, lost about seven pounds. Some of that is lean. So let's say I went from 156 down to 152 and a5 pounds, lost about seven pounds. Some of that is lean. So let's say I went from 156 down to 152.5,
Starting point is 00:17:28
so I lost about three and a half pounds of muscle, but lost about four pounds of fat. BMC doesn't change. And so body fat's actually gone down a little bit to seven and a half percent, but also my fat free mass index has gone down a little bit to 23%. Obviously still plenty high.
Starting point is 00:17:44
Just for reference at that age, my goal would be to make sure that my fat free mass index is above about 19. That would be kind of the 75th percentile. Real quick, that's the 75th percentile for FFMI is what you want your patients at above 75% or above. Yeah, when there's discordance between the ALMI and the FFMI, we tend to prefer the ALMI because it's, we actually have more data for ALMI. It's also a slightly more pure measurement. Why? Because in your limbs, you really only have muscle fat and bone.
Starting point is 00:18:22
So the ALMI truly tells you about what its name suggests. The appindicular lean mass index, it is the index of muscle mass in arms and legs. The fat free mass index, I guess I need to be a little more clear, is also true to its name, but the reality of it is it is somewhat confounded by the organs. So while we do that because it includes the musculature of the torso and things like that, you'll sometimes see percentile discordance. And in fact, you see that in me. We'll see that when we get to more recent data that I'm slightly discordant between those two. My FFMI tends to represent me at a higher percentile than my ALMI, probably because
Starting point is 00:18:59
I just have scrawny little arms. Okay, so as we march through 2011, 2012 and 2014, so you can see all of those tests. Those are all my keto days. So what am I doing during this period of time? Well, from 2011 to 2012, I now transition into cycling. So you see this change in my exercise where I am now spending just as much time exercising, but now it's on a bike, maybe even slightly more time. So I'm still, you know, lifting weights, but not quite as much, but I'm on a bike five days a week. Two of those days are really, really long days, Saturday, Sunday, and then there's three
Starting point is 00:19:39
week days where they're probably still 90 minutes to two hours. I'm still on a ketogenic diet. And I can have talked about that a lot, probably documented that. I'm sure I've written about it someplace. Not really experiencing any downside of a ketogenic diet, other than the restriction that obviously comes from it. And you can see at one point,
Starting point is 00:19:57
this isn't my lowest weight. My lowest weight was about 164 pounds, but my lowest weight captured on a Dexa was in October of 2012, and that was 167.5 pounds. Now by that point, my lean mass was down to about 145 pounds. So that's like 11 pounds less than the initial test in April, pardon me, in May of 2011. My body fat, percent was like what, nine and a half percent. In my ALMI, sorry, we're still not calculating that,
Starting point is 00:20:33
but my FFMI is still about 22. So again, as I talked about, I sort of decided at the end of, or the middle of 2014, that summer that I was just kind of done with a ketogenic diet. I think all my metrics of health were really good. Blood markers were great. My performance was great. It takes a while to adapt.
Starting point is 00:20:52
I want to be really clear. It took three months to just even get over the cliff of maybe it got over the hump, I should say, of feeling kind of miserable when I exercised. And I would say it took me 18 months to get to the point where I couldn't distinguish between being on and off carbohydrates. But there's no question that it's just a very restrictive way to eat. And so in the middle of 2014 is when I started to experiment with fasting. Real quick, when you were on the ketogenic diet, do you have an idea of how much
Starting point is 00:21:25
protein you are having during that time compared to now? Because I know you talk so much about protein being so important and seeing your lean mass drop like 11 pounds from May of 2011 to February of 2014, it actually dropped six pounds. Were you getting as much protein as you are now, you think? Thank you for listening to today's sneak peak AMA episode of the Drive.
