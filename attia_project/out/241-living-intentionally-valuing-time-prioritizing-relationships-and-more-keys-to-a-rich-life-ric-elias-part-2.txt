explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn more now, head over to peteratia MD dot com forward slash subscribe. Now without further delay, here's today's episode. I guess this week is Rick Elias. You may remember Rick as we released a podcast with Rick back in November of 2019. I think it was episode 79. We spoke at great length about his experience on flight 1549, also known as the miracle on the Hudson, in which his plane went down and was miraculously saved by Sally the pilot in the Hudson River. If you haven't yet listened to that interview, I recommend going back and doing so prior
Starting point is 00:01:17
to this conversation because in this conversation, we don't really repeat any of that amazing story. I think that that story alone is worth the price of admission. In this episode, we talk about a bunch of things. We talk about what's been new in Rick's life since the last interview, which has been over three years. We talk about raising kids and how we should think about our relationship with them as they grow older.
Starting point is 00:01:37
Talk about the importance of looking forward and not looking backward and how that ties into aging. In fact, there's a line that I use in the epilogue of my book that came directly from a discussion about this with Rick. Talk about the importance of true intentionality and how we live our lives and how we often don't really value our time if we think about it in relation to that. Talk about Rick's view on relationships and the impact that you can have on others, the importance of staying true yourself and the importance of struggles and more. This conversation is a great follow-up
Starting point is 00:02:08
to the recent podcast with Bill Perkins, both Bill and Rick have a lot of insights to share as we think about how we live our lives, how we live every day. And every time I speak with Rick, I learn something new and walk away with a new insight, something that I'm challenged by and something that I need to think about.
Starting point is 00:02:22
As a reminder, Rick's the co-founder and CEO of Red Ventures, a portfolio of digital companies, and hosts his own podcast called Three Things with Rick Allies. So without further delay, please enjoy my follow conversation with my dear friend, Rick Allies. Rick, great to have you back. And great to be spending time with you. Obviously, we had dinner last night, which was wonderful. So thanks for coming to Austin
Starting point is 00:02:48
That was such a treat last night getting to see you in full dad mode and beautiful family and great meal and lots of protein Indeed lots of protein. So although we're in touch Constantly from the standpoint of the listeners the last time they got to interact with you was probably almost exactly three years ago, 2019. Sometimes when I have folks back on, especially if it's a technical podcast, I kind of want to talk about, okay, well, what's new information since that time? Well, this obviously isn't very technical. Hopefully folks remember a lot of the story that we talked about. But nevertheless, what do you think of as the highs and lows for you of the last three years?
Starting point is 00:03:26
Because I know there have been both. Gosh, Peter, go back to that time and we had a specific conversation about leadership and we were talking about leaders, our only leaders in a time of crisis and we had talked about how the last decade had been super benign and how do we show up in crisis and then 60 days later, 90 days later boom COVID hits. So a lot of change, if you think about it the last three years have been the most tumultuous three years, no matter where you are in the world, not in any one country.
Starting point is 00:03:58
And then you layer that with lots, lots of changes. My kids have gone to college, my mother, which we talked a lot about in the podcast and my father-in-law and my aunt, which was like a second mom, all passed in that window. Our business went aggressively into offense when the market changed because we saw some opportunities we bought some very meaningful businesses and then everything kind of further imploded in one way. And then, you know, now we're living in the middle of a war and the middle of uncertainty and all of that. So the world, like always, keeps changing and surprising us.
Starting point is 00:04:32
We tend to project kind of today's reality into the future, but it's always changing. And how much of your even keel around all of these events, personal and professional, do you attribute to what happened in January of 2009? In terms of perspective, I mean, a lot. I really, I don't have a lot of lows. And I don't have a lot of high highs. I just, to me, as this understanding
Starting point is 00:04:56
that this too shall pass and doing what you can in the moment when you can is all that you really can do. And if you don't tie yourself up to the outcome as much and you're just really trying to stay in the process, I may not navigate this in great part because of that experience. One of the things we spoke about in the first podcast that you always have these moments of podcasts that sort of stick with you and that's probably true for listener. It's certainly true for the person doing the interview. The Rehandful of moments. One of them was this image of raising children is playing a game of tug of war that you eventually lose. Now, you can't lose it immediately. You can't just say, ready, go, let go of the rope. But, but the time they're off to college,
Starting point is 00:05:39
they've pulled you over the line metaphorically. At the time we had that discussion, you were still engaged in that tug of war, that your kids were not yet in college, now they are. I'm in the middle of that game, but I think about that constantly. Maybe start by retelling a little bit of that and explaining kind of if at all you're thinking has evolved or what you've learned about that game in the last few years. So that was probably the last meaningful lesson I got from my mom. She had onset of Alzheimer's and we would have
Starting point is 00:06:11
moments of that and I came and I was having coffee with her and I asked her some advice about our daughter who was plenty teenagerhood. She looked at me and said, my son, raising teenagers is a tug of war and then there was this silence and then she says that you ultimately most lose. And it is like you said, such an insightful, all-encompassing statement about parenting and is really the transition from really being, there will always be your kid,
Starting point is 00:06:39
but you will not always be their parent. And is that transition from now longer being their parent and maybe being more of a coach, maybe being more of an advisor, a friend, all of that, you will always treat them like your kids. So in our example, we're on the other side of this. I don't think of myself anymore as, you know, the parent. I'll always be that, but I'm not the parent. So the conversations are very different and I love it. There have been times where both of our kids have looked at us and said, I really appreciate your opinion. But this is what I'm choosing to do. And to me, that's a sign of really good kind of sense of your own decisions. And we disagree with them, but it is good to see them in their journey of
Starting point is 00:07:21
what the old thing now and their own. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not looking forward to it, but it's one of those things that you know is healthy, good, important. But you know, but have you noticed that difference in teenagerhood and how they start pushing away? Oh, yeah. And I've always believed that the reason why teenagerhood, teenagers are such a pain is so that you don't miss them when they leave. And I tell you, we love our kids and we're lucky that our kids love us back, but we
Starting point is 00:07:43
high-fived each other when we dropped them off. We did not cry. We were like, you know what, they're ready, we're ready. Empty nesting, it's a beautiful thing. You know, you still talk to them all the time and you still see them and all that. Then the funny part is that they're doing the same things that drove you crazy, you just don't see it. It doesn't feel as intense.
Starting point is 00:08:04
So let's talk a little bit about, well, I want to bring up something that happened kind of recently over the summer that I thought was spectacular. So early summer, you call me and said, hey, I'm having a get together in July, a couple of days, and I'm inviting, you gave me a bunch of details, none of which meant anything to me, right? What I took away from it was you wanted me to come out for a couple of days to your home, and there was gonna be a bunch of other guys there, at least one of whom I knew, but most of whom I did not.
Starting point is 00:08:31
And you prefaced it by saying, look, I know it's a big ask, I know how much you hate to travel. I know I had just come back from travel and I was just leaving the next day, I would have to fly back and then hop right on a plane. But you really urged me to come. And interestingly, I thought it was a birthday. And I sort of committed that I would think about it
Starting point is 00:08:51
and then talked about it with my wife and said, you know, I think this is special to Rick, I'm gonna go. Because I have a feeling it's one of those things where I'll spend the entire flight there kicking myself for going. But if I don't go, I suspect months later, I'll kick myself for not going. So I don't go, I suspect months later, I'll kick myself for not going.
Starting point is 00:09:06
So there's an asymmetry and regret. Yeah. So I ended up going and it went nothing to do with your birthday, which I think was like five months earlier. So I don't know where I got that from. Tell us about what was the motivation for that and why do you think that ended up being a really special time for where there's 40 of us there or something? About 30,. About 30.
Starting point is 00:09:25
Yeah. Okay. When you go back through your year and you go back and ask yourself, what was truly memorable of the year? At least in my case, there may be eight or ten things that you will remember well into the future. And what is universal about those things is they're usually experiences and their experiences with people that you have a deep connection with.
Starting point is 00:09:50
So I have become very, very focused on creating experiences with people that I love as a way to create memorable moments of the year. Because I think that really is what we grow old with is the memories. But the memories alone are not enough, is the memories with people and the more that kind of the richer. So I wanted to experiment with the concept of, let's create a friend summit,
Starting point is 00:10:14
let's bring 30 super interesting friends. The uniqueness of it is everybody's been curated by me. Everybody there was a friend. So I think immediately everybody showed up with like, okay, if there were friends, I'm going to be open-minded. I'm not there kind of doing like, what do you do? Who do you are? It's more around how do you know Rick and then what is interesting about each other. You know, we had a lot of the same participants speak that we curated, that we didn't over-occur straight up, but we curated the agenda and then we had all sorts of things
Starting point is 00:10:43
around food and magician and all this other stuff. And the greatest thing happened, which is one of the things that I love most, is when my good friends become great friends. And I know for a fact, because I was with Rick Hendrick a week ago and we spent 15 minutes talking about you, about Matt Walker, about other people that you guys all have become friends. And what greater currency in life than spreading love through friendship. And it was a huge home run because everybody there, even those who came as a gift to me, I think left with a gift of new friends.
Starting point is 00:11:18
And at our age, it's not easy to make a new friends. And it is something that we can do by leveraging our own friendships. And you've been good to me in this regard. I asked you when I heard your interview with Matt and say, hey, would you introduce me and we become dear, dear friends. Like I talked to him all the time. So I don't know, it's all around this currency
Starting point is 00:11:37
that friendships really matter in life, memories, memorable moments really matter and how do you bring all that together. I was surprised by the number of guys I walked away from that meeting with who I couldn't wait to see again. And you know, it's like, hey, when I'm in LA, I'll give you a call when you're in Austin, you give me a call. What did you learn during that summit?
Starting point is 00:11:59
Because there was some structure to it as well where there were folks that, you know, it was kind of like a bunch of fireside chats effectively. Did anything surprise you? Did you learn anything? I learned don't schedule something like that right after a vacation, because I spent my whole vacation thinking about
Starting point is 00:12:15
A&S and it's kind of interview most people, including you. So that was a lesson which has created some gap between something in your relaxing time. I learned that, you know, I think all of us, no matter what, neat moments like that where no matter who you are to the outside world, you're the one and the same in that group.
Starting point is 00:12:35
So there were professional athletes, there were governors, there were CEOs, there were true people like our exception and their feel like you, but everybody there was the same. that this knows this essence of the guard can be down from everybody and Never be I've got to like hang out with 30 of my best friends and give lots of hugs and catch up and have moments and create memories and You know relationships take a lot of effort and that was a really a fishing way to like make huge deposits into a bunch of important accounts. I'm blanking on his name. He was the older gentleman on the very last day
Starting point is 00:13:11
that spoke Walter Green. No, no, no, not Walter. I remember Walter. Marshall Roush. No, Walter was amazing in his own right. And actually, Walter's someone I want to have on the podcast. You should.
Starting point is 00:13:21
We know it's really funny. We used to be neighbors in San Diego and didn't even know it. I'm my good. I'm the same neighborhood like live to mile from each other I love all through green you know Walter mentors hundred people like us and we're all better because of it so that's someone on our hit list for podcast guest so martial who's I don't know that's 200 years old by me now and I actually and I think from Marshall came one of the most interesting lessons that you drew out. And it's a lesson about looking forward versus looking backward and how that ties to age.
Starting point is 00:13:54
Do you want to recount that story? Yeah, so I've known Marshall about 20 years. I've had, I don't know, 100 lunches with Marshall. So when I met him, he was probably 81, 82, and he was still driving and he'll come in and there was something about Marshall. There is something about Marshall that he's incredibly appealing and attractive.
Starting point is 00:14:15
It is that every time you see him once a month, every other month, he has a list of things that he has learned that he wants to talk about. He has ideas about things he wants to do. He's constantly evolving and thinking, and what I've learned from Marshall is that your age really can be told by what you think about. Aging of our spirit, not of our bodies, not of our mind, but of our spirit. It's really about which mirror you're using.
Starting point is 00:14:45
Are you using the rear view mirror or the windshield? I told a story there, right, where he's like, completely worried about one of his kids and really thinking about giving them a tough lesson because it is time and is asking for my opinion. And I said, Marshall, how old is your son? And he goes 72. So it was a point of he never stopped thinking.
Starting point is 00:15:05
And doing that, and that's how he leads. He turns 100 in February, and we're going to do something super special. I hope. The other story I like about him was, I think when he was 96, he came to you with a pretty serious business idea. And it was really predicated on trends over the next 10 years. Correct. And it was like, look, today this isn't necessarily an enormous opportunity, but here's all the data for why 10 years from now, this is a home run. We need to act now and make sure we build this business. And you're sort of thinking, you're 96 years old. Why are you thinking about a business opportunity that's going to, you know, mushroom in the next
Starting point is 00:15:42
10 years? And he was a senator for North Carolina for 26 years. There's a highway name after him. He's uniqueness. He's a Jewish, but he made all his money selling Christmas ornaments, like all the things that are so unique about him. And he's incredibly close to his kids and his grandkids and he sees the world so clearly, even when you talk about current events and politics
Starting point is 00:16:05
today, he has a wisdom about he literally played basketball at Duke in 1939, I believe. You know, he went to World War II. This guy and all of that, you know, and he has had tremendous hardships. He lost his wife. He's lost some kids and they dignity by which he handles it is just distilled in a wisdom of life that I find super attractive. I really think and again, this is one of those, there's like the soft science and there's the hard science. I spend most of my life thinking about the hard science of living longer, the things that we can measure, the metrics we can measure, the biomarkers we can measure, how we can predicate our assumptions of risk based on X, Y, and Z. But there's simply no question
Starting point is 00:16:48
that there are these soft metrics that we can't quantify, but they must matter. And I look at my dad as an example of this. So my dad, who is 85 years old, not the healthiest guy in the world, but he has outlived everybody in his completely unhealthy family by more than two decades. This is a guy who came from a family where there were, you know, nine kids, one died as
Starting point is 00:17:10
a child, the other seven have all died. Again, nobody came close to his longevity. And to be clear, he's not remotely a beacon of health. You've been as your dad, huh? No, no, no. Wouldn't listen to a thing I've said if my life depended on it. Never mind the fact that his life depends on it. And look, he probably doesn't have that many years left on this planet. But I deep down believe that his relatively modest longevity, again,
Starting point is 00:17:37
relative to what I think his genetic capacity comes down to exactly this phenomenon. He never is looking back. He is planning. He is planning. He's got an idea. I mean, when he should have been retiring, he bought quarries. He bought swaths of undeveloped limestone land. In his 60s, with the idea that this is going to be, there will be a demand for high quality limestone, dolomite, and granite in the next 30 years. And he's out there in a quarry every day, barely able to walk because his knees are so messed
Starting point is 00:18:13
up. And I'm convinced to my greatest sadness that one day he's going to fall on these rocks and smash his head or something. But the idea of just sitting around couldn't possibly occur to him, let alone relaxing. Now, again, we could talk about whether I think there's some, maybe one should enjoy life a little bit more, but for him, I think enjoyment is building, is thinking about opportunity. Like, there's this niche for this market of limestone that nobody has really appreciated
Starting point is 00:18:40
the value of, and that's where he's going to pour himself into. And it reminded me of that story with Marshall. I've studied a lot of people that are finishing life well, 70s and 80s. I think we're all pretty predictable. We just got to find patterns that we relate to that relate to us. And I have lots of friends like Henry Kravis is a very, very good friend. Henry's in his mid to late 70s and, you know what, he is a complete stud. And I'm sure he's changing and evolved a lot as one of the great leaders in Wall Street.
Starting point is 00:19:14
But you sit down with him and he has more energy and more passion and he's thinking more about the future. And I think there's something to be said by staying in the arena. Even if you downshift, I think there's something to be said to your brain stays connected, you stay relevant, you don't feel old because you don't feel irrelevant. Have you read Arthur Brooks's book From Strength to Strength? I've read excerpts, I listen to your podcast, I talk to him, I don't know him as well as you do, but we know each other. I think a lot of what he says to run this and is crystallized intelligence that he talks about.
Starting point is 00:19:48
I think it's interesting because I lack about 30 points of IQV to be the two of you. Like literally, I listen to the podcast and I'm like, all right, I had a pause and go, look at some stuff in the dictionary. But to me, the crystallized intelligence is more to me of the evolution of our brain and the aging of our brain, but that way that we stay productive for the tribe, for the society. More than a elevation of it is an evolutionary off, notwithstanding, I thought your podcast with him was tremendous. I really enjoyed speaking with Arthur, I enjoyed his
Starting point is 00:20:20
book, I read it twice, and I really, it hit home a lot because even though I'm not yet 50, there's simply no question. I don't have the horsepower I had when I was 20 or 25, like where I feel like I was really at my cerebral peak. And I think as he talked about and wrote about the transition from fluid to crystallize intelligence, it really gave me some comfort in accepting this transition so that to your point and why I brought this up is, yeah, I think it is important to stay on the field, but I also think it's important to understand that it's okay to move to a different position.
Starting point is 00:20:58
Well, I think that replacing this notion of like, I don't have the horsepower is redefining what that horsepower is That gives us continued feeling of growth. I think the importance of life. It's really not necessarily the looking forward is constantly growing. I think the day that you stopped growing is the day you age. I agree with that completely and This kind of brings it back to what we talked about a minute ago, which is, I mean, I am sad when I think about my kids not being little. And I'm not sure what that's about. But, you know, we talked about it very briefly at dinner yesterday because you got to see both my boys
Starting point is 00:21:37
in complete action, which we're not shy about. We don't make any apology for the fact that they are high energy. But they you were really loving. You were so physical. I really was so reminded me of my relationship, but I also felt your joy and love. What Jill and I often say to each other, you have to say this in the bad times. So yesterday they were well-behaved, but there's equal number of times when, I mean, you'd think that they're psychotic.
Starting point is 00:22:04
You can't believe how poorly they behave, you know, like, well, we're in there. Literally. Joe will kill me for even telling this publicly. Like the other day, she walked by the youngest one and I don't know where he just took his pencil and stabbed her in the butt. Unprovoked, it's not like she said, go to your, but in those moments, I say, I know it can be really hard. If I could freeze time, I would, which is a totally irrational thing to say. Why do you think that is? Did you feel that way when you and your kids were at this stage, which is,
Starting point is 00:22:33
you are their world, you're still daddy, not dad? I think this is an amazing stage, and I feel fortunate to be going through it a little later in life when I think I can appreciate it. I think had I been presented with this 20 years earlier, I wouldn't have had the maturity to embrace it as much, maybe. I think that's right. You may not have the same energy you would have had, but you have plenty and especially, I think that's straight up that we have when we have kids younger or older.
Starting point is 00:23:02
The great thing about having kids is we get to kind of almost relive life. And I think there's something very subconscious about rediscovering things, or seeing things through their eyes that brings the child back in us. You know, I think that child is a safe place in all of our personas. I also think that there's this notion of this is how we are relevant in the world. This is how we are going to stay here when we're no longer here, it's through them, because a lot of us will live through them. And that's why we are so committed to it.
Starting point is 00:23:35
And it's such a powerful job to have and responsibility that is heightened in every sense. And the good and the bad and the reality is that all the things that they're doing are just normally growth moments of their own brain development and all that good stuff. And we talked a lot about it the last time in the podcast, but I think we will, we're parents.
Starting point is 00:23:55
Very the youngest is obsessed with math right now. He's five, he's starting to learn how to add. And the other day we were sitting there, he's sitting with me on the couch, Reese's three years older is sitting at his desk doing some coloring and he goes, you know, when I'm a hundred, Reese is gonna be 103.
Starting point is 00:24:12
And then he looks at me and he goes, how old are you gonna be? Wait, 70? And I go, no, I wish buddy. I'm gonna be long dead when you're a hundred. Oh, that's cool. But if I were alive, I'd be, you know, 140, whatever. First of all, that's an amazing thought to me because I do think that kids
Starting point is 00:24:29
today will quite easily be a hundred years old. You know, today to make it to a hundred right now is a pretty remarkable feat. You know, centenarians are exceedingly rare about 0.004 percent of the population. I tend to think that kids that are born now will reach that level at a far greater frequency. And so it was a bit of a sobering thought. It's like, I'm looking at this little chubby, cute kid that I can't stop wanting to squeeze and hug and kiss and realize that he's going to be a hundred year old man one day. And I'll be probably long gone. All of that stuff is sober. I guess it brings me to the idea of how do you, I mean, you strike me as a person for whom a lot of purpose came from your kids.
Starting point is 00:25:11
And so as your kids are older, do you feel less of that? And is that caused you to put more of your sense of purpose into something we'll talk about later, like philanthropy, which is also very important to you? I'm very challenged by this notion of, how do I help evolve our relationship into more of a coaching relationship? In a way that I can be still their father, but also be a sounding board amongst many others. And this morning I had a conversation with my son,
Starting point is 00:25:40
a lot around something he's dealing with. And I said, I'm going to talk to you as if you were a mentee of mine. And I gave him what I thought as an advisor. I said, you gotta do whatever you want, but I want you to know that I am a resource for you. You are not alone in solving this problems, and just like you have other people,
Starting point is 00:25:57
and I really enjoy kind of this morphing of the relationship, it's early for us. But by the way, I think that's why people enjoy grandkids so much. It's not that I can give them back when all that. Yeah, that kind of really matters. It's a chance to almost do it again. Do it again with lower expectations of like, oh, it's that reflecting on me as a parent or say, all this stuff is just we have this innate desire to perpetuate ourselves. And we do that through our kids.
Starting point is 00:26:24
Yeah, you've probably heard me talk about the Centenary in Decathlon and for me, one of the greatest motivations personally, and I do find that for many of my patients, because we talk about this in such detail, I think it's true for them also, is what they want to be able to do with offspring and more importantly, the children of their offspring. And you've probably seen me do this, but we do an exercise where you kind of build a timeline. You know, you put your age down and these are your kids and then you start to estimate, you know, or bracket, my kids will likely have kids when they are this age, this age, this age, I will therefore be this age.
Starting point is 00:27:02
And you don't need to spend too long doing this to come to the realization that the things that you want to be able to enjoy doing with your grandkids will range from the really extravagant, like I want to take them on the greatest vacation. We're going to go to Egypt and we're going to scale the great pyramids and go down the Nile. Okay, well that's great. Alternatively, it's going to be the really mundane. Like I want to be able to play catch. I wanted to share it with you a story that I haven't shared yet, which is after the plane crash a couple of weeks later, I was watching my daughter perform in kindergarten.
Starting point is 00:27:33
It was a really important moment of the realization of like, for now, this is my most important purpose, which is to really help my kids become adults. And it came full circle without me knowing it. I was at her graduation from high school. She's a sophomore now in college. And they're coming down and it was outside because of COVID and they're coming down this kind of hallway in the same emotion that had not happened for, I don't know, 11 years happened.
Starting point is 00:28:04
I started bowling uncontrollably as I saw her. I didn't expect it. It came out of nowhere. I'm not a cryer. I'm not afraid to cry, but I know I'm walking around. And it was a realization that I had lived to the moment where she had become her own person. And the graduation from high school was a lot more meaningful than just the graduation, at least in my experience It was a realization that she can fly on her own now It was a moment It was a moment for me in that realization, but then also realizing that okay
Starting point is 00:28:34
I now have more capacity to broaden purpose, right? I think we're all seeking purpose or it's not like you finish it. It's just you evolve it I was very grateful to have had that experience because seldomly in life, do you get to see the end of the circle come back? It's usually a line that goes somewhere or nowhere. When we last spoke, I think you talked a little bit about any follow-up or interactions you've had with either the crew from that flight or Captain Salenberger himself. What's the latest on that? I imagine that I don't remember how many people run that flight or Captain Celenberger himself. What's the latest on that? I imagine that I don't remember how many people run that flight, 154 plus the crew 58, 158 total. There's 158 of you
Starting point is 00:29:12
that I'm sure some people have passed away due to natural causes since, but that's a very tight knit group I'm guessing. Do you all collectively celebrate that anniversary together? There's always something and there's Facebook groups and all that stuff. I've been more on the fringe. I've participated in a couple of things. It's just time. I got a lot of what I needed, especially at the time from my closest friends and family. But you asked me at the last podcast because we were presenting him that award at the points guy event. I've seen him enough and why not? And I told you that I was planning to do something. Well, it is happening. I don't know if you know this, but the plane itself, which it's worth seeing because it is banged up like a plane will be banged up if it hit a wall at a hundred and
Starting point is 00:29:56
you know, 50 some miles an hour. So it really is not the plane is a shell of the plane. It's in Charlotte. And for a bunch of different reasons, the all hanger and museum, we'd lost all the facilities. So the airport, they were gonna move the plane to Dallas. Wait, it ended up in Charlotte because that's where US air was- Yeah, based out of it. So just by total coincidence in your backyard.
Starting point is 00:30:18
And then there was a lot of risk that we were gonna lose and there's a bunch of other planes there, but that's the anchor plane. So a number of us rallying the community. Is that normal, by the way, after a plane wreck that, I would have guessed that they normally scrap planes. I think this one because of the historic route. They wanted to keep people from the city of Oregon, right? And so a group of people in Charlotte, rallying, I made a donation with asking for the naming rights. So the thing that I'm going to do to honor Sully and the crew and perpetuate this notion I was doing my job.
Starting point is 00:30:46
Remember that statement is we're going to name the museum after him and the museum will be in Charlotte in Charlotte. So with a Sullenberger aviation museum with the carliners or something like that, but it will be his name and I call them to ask for his permission. And he was interesting hesitant at first and then he called me back and I said, okay, let's do it. And the naming and all of that will happen in January. So it'll be a big event. 14th anniversary. Yeah. And it'll be a beautiful day. But I wanted to find something that will last both of us as a way to honor his commitment to doing his craft and to saving our lives. By this point in the podcast, I think most people, if they haven't familiar as yourself with this story, you should probably go back and listen to that section of our podcast
Starting point is 00:31:27
as the way I think you tell that story. It's probably the longest version you've told of it, because obviously you have a TED talk where you go through it in some detail, which is really moving, but I think also just the, you know, I'm still, so remember how I said from our first meeting, there are a couple of things that stand out. The other thing that really stands out from our first podcast, which is something you sort of said in almost passing. Do you know what I'm about to say? Oh, no.
Starting point is 00:31:50
I've shared this with you, but it's when the plane is coming down and you're going through, once you realize there's about 10 seconds until you're gonna die, you set a couple things. One, it's very calm. You weren't scared. You were sad. You're very sad. And you put your hand on your leg or on your other hand on your arm and said, I love you. As the last thing you said to yourself before you would have died. Close my eyes.
Starting point is 00:32:18
And I just couldn't believe that. I was like, that's the last thing I'd ever think to say. What would you have said? I probably would have said nothing. I probably would have just been very sad. And yeah, I don't think there would have been any gratitude or anything like that in me. Have you actually asked any of the other people on the flight what they did said thought in the last 10 seconds? No, I haven't, and I will,
Starting point is 00:32:41
because I think it would be interesting. I would, there's a whole book there. Yeah, for sure And remember that we had no suffering. I imagine if you're dying, you know, in some level of distress You know your mind is in a very different place coping But that's what makes this such an interesting quote-unquote control experiment is yeah, you weren't on fire and it's 90 seconds You know a lot of people have near death experience that lasts a second or two seconds. I reflected a lot, Peter, on the TED Talk was a moment in time and it was all around, okay, here's kind of the three regrets I felt as the plane was coming down. And we talked a lot about them and the other podcasts. We should revisit them, by the way, just
Starting point is 00:33:20
so that folks can see it all in one place. So it was this notion that everything changes in an instant. So time really, really matters. It was this notion that relationships are at the core of the richness of life. But yet we spend a lot of time with our ego kind of leading the charge. And then this notion with around my kids, which is I wasn't living true to what I discovered was my true
Starting point is 00:33:45
purpose at the time or my main purpose, which is seeing my kids. It was the regret that I felt at the time of my look like death to have missed it, to not being clear that that really was the map, the key to living a better life. As it reflected, all of that, what's interesting is nothing has really changed, but is not around regrets. Same for example, instead of it being around everything changes in an instant, so living the moment, it is that, but's wrapped around a notion of having true intentionality about how we live our life. And true intentionality about how we live a life is a really big, deep bucket that I've spent lots and lots of time thinking about. It has a lot to do with time. And the reality with time, and I've heard this, and I love it, it's like the problem with time,
Starting point is 00:34:44
is the same problem that we have most things that are free. We don't value it. If we like how to get up and like really spend real money on time, I bet you we will behave differently. And the problem with time is, as we have learned about sleep, is you have to do a lot of things to extend your time, some so that you're more productive the next day, like sleep and some like nutrition and exercise, so that you have more time, right? So a lot of what you are really trying to do is convince people that there are things
Starting point is 00:35:11
they can do to have more quality at meaningful time. But it is a lot more than that to me to live with intentionality is around kind of combining a lot of things into where we spend our energy and what the things that we stop doing and how do we kind of reverse things that we don't want to do. So I really think that this notion of having complete intention is really a core of living a more rich life. So I feel my life to be very rich because, for example, I have 242 weeks left until I turn 60. You know, I have all this little exercises where I'll say, okay, what are my big intentions this week?
Starting point is 00:35:53
Because you know, at 60, I'm in a different energy level. I'm probably paying a bunch of physical debts back. Like, there's so a lot that I'll come back. And then I live in chunks of my life with just great intention. It is because of that. Because I realize that everything really is fleeting, but it's not just around time and time only.
Starting point is 00:36:14
And that manifests itself in the second one when you talk about relationships. What I realize is that, you know, a little bit of the event that we were talking about, I wanna continue to meet new people that I can learn from. I am addicted to learning and growth. And the best way to do that is through other people. So the amount of energy I put into friendships because it's not relationships. You know, the good news is when you're in business, you have a lot of deal friends. The key is how do you convert them into real friends? Who do
Starting point is 00:36:42
you want to convert into real friends and to be a real friend? Talk about a skill to be learned talk about it being a never ending journey now. How do you approach that? So I'm really really I have an enormous amount of great Friends more than most because I spent the bulk of my time on that Yeah, if you go back to time. There's only three things you can do with it You can waste it which a lot of teenagers do. You can use it in things that are value and then you can invest it. There's nothing else you can do with time.
Starting point is 00:37:13
So the ratio of what you do with those three components has a lot to do with it. So guys like you and I, at least, we don't waste a lot of time. The question is, how much are you using it for things that give you pleasure or things that you want to do and how much are you investing? And that will ultimately be continuing to pay dividends in life. So if you look at your time, you'll know how much of that it is. And if you're using too much and something, at some point becomes wasteful, you may. So relationships are super rich. And then the last thing is, you know, this notion of purpose is how do you expand that. So I spend a lot of time trying to continue to evolve the gift and not look at it as a moment in time, but as some level of a map into the future and as I continue to age.
Starting point is 00:37:55
What do you think the next decade holds for you in terms of red ventures? So maybe give us a bit of an update on, well, maybe again, remind people what Red Ventures is. It's not an easy thing to explain. It's not like we make a widget. It's funny because I explained it in the last podcast three years ago, differently than I'm going to explain it now. It really is a, basically, a private equity platform of companies that we control.
Starting point is 00:38:20
So instead of investing as a passive investor, we control a bunch of companies. And we have about 17 companies. Those companies, the fact that we don't own 100% of them, but we control all of them. And they're all over the place. They're in Europe and Brazil. We're starting the first bank and put a Recon in 26 years. And then we own a bunch of brands in the US, mostly digital brands. We own services companies.
Starting point is 00:38:41
So it's just really a platform of tech and data and digital and really, really strong culture and a purposeful place to work. How many employees do you have now? We are up to 4500 employees. When I came out to visit you for a business review circa 2014, 2015, how big were you then? 1200, 1200, beautiful campus. Still the same. Still beautiful, it's just people are not going in as often. The world has really changed. A relationship with work has really changed. For better?
Starting point is 00:39:16
For both, like anything in life. Everything has pros and cons. I think COVID did a lot of good for society. I think COVID realized that this fixed way that we thought about our relationship with work team have to be and that those rules got established way early in the industrial age for control. And control is a false premise in every regard.
Starting point is 00:39:37
But at the same time, I'll tell you my reflection on this and what I worry about a little bit and a little bit of a different topic. But I think that one of the unique things about the U.S. and you don't see this in a lot of other countries, having studied a lot of Latin American countries, is that the decade between 20 and 30 is a decade of true apprenticeship in that all these companies, corporations and hospital systems, they're really training people into their second,
Starting point is 00:40:06
third of life. So you spend the first decade of your life. Hopefully if you're lucky, you have good enough parents where you learn a lot, then school becomes a place you work, and then whatever your profession is, that third decade of life is incredibly important. And that's where you really built a lot of depth and learn on someone else's nickel and all this stuff.
Starting point is 00:40:25
And I worry that we're going to look back in 10 years and the US will allow us a sense of competitiveness because a lot of this people coming into the workforce are getting a fraction of the tutoring and coaching and experiences and intuition that they would have had. And 30, 40 years from now, we will loss a lot of our age because we stopped investing in the people and their creativity and their skill. Meaning that's a downside of not being in an immersive culture. At least for that segment or that age of the population.
Starting point is 00:40:56
Now, I would argue that I think what we learn in COVID is flexibility is king. And we should celebrate and look for flexibility. And we shouldn't be able to sacrifice raising kids if you're a working mother or working father or we don't have to travel Crazy like we were traveling. So a lot of that is baked into Changes in the rules of engagement, but this is all a moment in time You know if we go into a recession some of this habits may return
Starting point is 00:41:22
I hope we never lose the flexibility we gain. I don't love going to work every day at the same time and leaving at the end of the day. I love having a lot more freedom. And I think most people do. Do we know if, I mean, presumably, there are certain jobs that work really well remotely versus not, and there are presumably certain types of people who work really well remotely versus not? I don't have and haven't spent much time looking at any of this, but I imagine given the
Starting point is 00:41:48
size of your company and the footprint of red ventures, do you have any insights into that? I think there's two components to that. One is productivity, which is at least in some functions fairly easy measured. We have lots of editors that write real content. They are as productive or more. They don't have to commute and do lots and lots of things that are distracting in the office.
Starting point is 00:42:09
They are some places in engineering where that is also true, maybe some of the places in the backend engineering where you're not doing a lot of collaboration. And those people, NetNet, you would argue that, remote, not hybrid, the very different things. NetNet may be more positive. Now, the second
Starting point is 00:42:25
side of that equation, I think being alone or being in your home every day has a real tax on mental health. We're designed to be with others. And I don't think we know the real value or tax on that. Now, a lot of the other jobs, hybrid in my opinion, where you're collaborating with people, where you're learning experientially, where you're building intuition, it's a healthier way to gain expertise on something. Do you mean hybrid like you come in sometimes and you work remote sometimes? There's a lot of things we do during the week that you don't need to be in a place. My hope is that ultimately work evolves into what are the things that require people to be together versus what are not and then depending on where you are in your career and your proficiency you have even more flexibility.
Starting point is 00:43:13
How long do you think you'll be doing red ventures as your quote unquote day job versus working on some of the many things that seemingly are just as much interest to you, but are more on the non-profit side. I feel super healthy and great part thanks to you. A little, I feel like I've at least slowed down a lot of the aging and I'm really grateful. So as long as I feel healthy, I'd love this perch. I don't back to the martial conversation. I don't intend to, I never want to replace happy with happier in anything in life. And I'm happy as can be.
Starting point is 00:43:47
You know, would it continue to evolve? Yes, would it continue to change? And one of the big, a hazing COVID, you know, COVID to me was unique in so many ways. One, I got to do something for a second time, which we usually don't do in life. When something kind of goes away, goes away, the fact that we got our kids home for
Starting point is 00:44:05
like a year and a half, it was wonderful. But for me, Red Ventures will continue to evolve, but what will happen is a lot of our companies will gain independence. So instead of Red Ventures being one thing, we will find the right outcomes and marriages of a lot of our businesses with the right partners, and allow those people to become CEOs of their own businesses and will create monetization and return for our investors, but our ability to stay private and stay independent and stay away from all the other stuff that public companies have to deal with. It's non-negotiable. So I see red ventures in a bizarre way returning to its roots in the next 25 years to a much simpler thing Work most of our businesses will evolve out. We'll continue to buy businesses in the next 10 years.
Starting point is 00:44:49
But I guess is when I turn 80, I'll have 15 people and we will be hoping to give all our money away. Speaking of giving money away, you've recently signed the giving pledge? Yeah, about a year and a half ago. Tell us a bit about that. I mean, I think people have heard of the giving pledge, but what does it mean and what type of people consign it and what are the implications of it? It was not something that we did without a lot of trepidation.
Starting point is 00:45:12
It's something that really building malindigates and Warren Buffett started. And it was around creating consciousness of the people that have had more luck than others and creating real wealth to create a commitment and responsibility that you will give. At least 50% of that wealth back. That's what the pledge is about. That's during your lifetime as well, correct? Yeah, or when you die.
Starting point is 00:45:31
It doesn't matter. But you are committing that's the pledge you sign, and there's hundreds of people that have signed it all over the world. So it's a bit of a community too, where you learn how to give it in ways that reflect what you want to do and all of that. So there's real value of being part of the community. When we first met, we had the privilege of having dinner in Omaha with Warren Buffett, and they were trying to convince people at the time, our kids were still in high school,
Starting point is 00:45:56
and we didn't want this burn because it does create negative energy around it. And it gives a lot of people meaning because it makes public the amount of wealth that you have. It is threshold which at the time we were private companies so no one had known but when the New York Times wrote an article and all this stuff it kind of became public what it was but it's just more I wanted to shelter them from anything that negative that may come out of that. They were too young so we waited until they went to college or when they went to college they called back and said hey you say when your kids work out of college, you do it.
Starting point is 00:46:25
And when we did it, and we're grateful we did, but we were planning to do this anyway. And we do it more as a pledge that hopefully others realize that there's only works. If it works for everybody, it doesn't work. If it works only for a few and putting it back into the system in the core, that's what you're hoping to do. Did you ever hear the podcast I did with John Arnold? I did not. Okay, so definitely one you'll wanna listen to.
Starting point is 00:46:48
So John and Laura Arnold, who've also signed a giving pledge, are probably two of the most deliberate philanthropists I've ever met. John was, I think you could say, hands down the most successful energy trader in the history of energy trading. He was a trader at Enron, right out of college, and became their most successful trader.
Starting point is 00:47:09
In fact, if I'm not mistaken, I think his personal book of business was generating a billion dollars a year for Enron, just his own personal trades. When Enron imploded, he was handed a severance check of something like five million dollars, and he took every penny of it, put it into his fund, and went on a 10-year tear of unparalleled returns, something like 30% per month. Okay.
Starting point is 00:47:34
So, you know, at the time that John shut his fund down, which I think was 2011 or 2012, before the age of 40, he basically completely turned himself to what he's been doing for the last 10 years, which is just philanthropy But doing it with a level of rigor and analytics in other words He's done something that I think is really interesting and highlights something really hard Which is it's actually not that easy to give away billions of dollars. I mean if you you want to do it intelligently, I mean, you can obviously give money to entities that build buildings, build a hospital. Those things are great. But you know, when you look at the sort of projects that John is interested in, it takes time. And I think John and his wife correctly came to the realization that they can't wait until they're 65 to start doing this.
Starting point is 00:48:25
They will run out of time because they have too much money. How do you think about that balance? Because I know there are things that you are really committed to. Maybe we can talk about some of those things. The two that jumped to mind, of course, are the children, forget the exact name for undocumented kids who are not born here, but brought here young, educated here, and then can't work. And then of course, a lot of disaster relief in Puerto Rico, but also just infrastructure
Starting point is 00:48:52
and building up there. So, let's talk a bit about these things. So, first, I really think that only governments have the muscle to really solve problems. And I think even people with the wealth of building malindigates have come to a lot of that conclusion. You can attack singular problems that maybe eradicate a disease or something like that. If you have billions and billions of dollars,
Starting point is 00:49:11
but through systemic issues, I think the role of any nonprofit is to gain momentum, to create a roadmap, to create the case for governments to really put real funding behind things or create the systemic changes to changes. I don't think that the illusion of like quirklin effects are real issues. To me, this is more around.
Starting point is 00:49:29
But there is something you, or and I want to say you, I don't just mean you personally, but I mean there is something that the philanthropist can do that the government won't do, which is you can take a risk financially that a government can't do.
Starting point is 00:49:41
You can demonstrate a proof of principle that as you said, then becomes a template or roadmap for a policy maker to say, well, here's a pilot study that was done that demonstrated X, Y, and Z. This was very high risk. We never would have done it, but, oh my god, look what we learned. This is now something that could be replicated at scale. And you bring in, in other words, the philanthropist can effectively function as the angel investor or the early stage VC and the government comes in as the PE investor. And in that regard, I think bringing an entrepreneurial spirit and when putting real business sabbiness behind it is really important.
Starting point is 00:50:15
I think it was Jeff Bees' a long time ago. He said something around, in philanthropy, you're not really necessarily looking for the perfect business plan. You're helping somebody, you're doing good. And that's a little of my approach, like do things that are good for the world and it's good for one person, then you're doing something and trying to do it in scale and with purpose and all of that. As it relates to what we're doing, Peter, you know, keeps evolving.
Starting point is 00:50:40
We're really focused on this 16 to 24. That's our concentration of people that are under resource. And it is more than undocumented kids, although we just close our applications again. And this kids are still in limbo, meaning there's no path to anything. They're just have this basically permit that gets renewed, but no one can get the permit anymore. So every year about 80 thousand kids are graduating high school that I have no ability to get a work permit. It's just insane. So just so people understand these are kids that came here undocumented. So they're born in another country. They've come here. They've grown up here, though. They've gone to high school here. They could go to college, but they wouldn't get financial aid because of
Starting point is 00:51:20
course, they're not residents. Tell me what actually happens. How many of them say I have to go back to the country I was born in versus I'm going to get in college and somehow take a bunch of debt without any financial aid. My guess is that 95% of them end up taking minimum wage jobs or jobs that are underground and stuff like that. There was a process there where you can get a DACA permit. There's 650,000 of this gets at a DACA permit. There's 650,000 of this kids that have DACA permits, so you can work. Unfortunately, in the last administration,
Starting point is 00:51:50
DACA got rescinded, so there's no new DACA. So if you are a high school student, you're 17, you can't get a work permit. So at that point, you grew up here, your families now here going back to your original country of may happen but it's really really hard. You have no roots there, you have no resources, you may not even know the language for that matter. That's the craziness of this. We have invested. What's the distribution of where these kids are from? Do we have a sense of that? Probably 90% Latin America, probably 2-3% to those Mexico, just because of how they're coming in illegally. But you see them a lot from Southeast Asia and other places.
Starting point is 00:52:25
We just our yearly scholarship grant, we just got 1200 applicants literally close last week. I believe over 300 of them have close to a 4.0 on-way to GP. You're providing scholarships for these kids to go to college because they don't need to be residents to go to college. They just need the funding. The funding. Yeah, so you don't get federal financial aid in about half the state, don't give you in state tuition. So it's almost like you would have to go to school as a, you know, to a private school and pay 60, 70 grand a year. And is the investment you're making, Rick, that if these kids crush it in college, they're
Starting point is 00:52:58
going to get an H1B visa on the back end or they're going to land in some legitimate dual intent visa with a path to citizenship based on their education. Well, until three years ago, because of World Daca, they had a path to getting jobs. And there's many now that have jobs. We have 520 kids in the program, about half of them are graduating, but we keep thinking this is the last year, this is the last year because Congress just needs to pass a law. There's plenty of reasons why it hasn't happened.
Starting point is 00:53:26
But now the kids are going to start graduating next year. They're literally in limbo because they can't get a work permit. So the H1BV and all of that can't do it. You can figure out a way to marry and then take that route. You can look for a asylum, but those are all really, really hard paths. I didn't realize that. So you're telling me that if a kid goes through a scholarship, oh, because they're not doing it on an F one, that they're not DACA. That expired. It doesn't, it said that's the argument now is like not only do you have the DACA kids in limbo, but now you're like 80,000 kids every year that were, and the crazy thing is we invest in them in primary school and secondary school. We don't ask the question when they go to our school systems, but then we invest all that money.
Starting point is 00:54:09
Why don't we make them taxpayers? We have an issue. There's this massive decline of kids applying to college. We have all this college infrastructure with not enough students, or not educated them, and make them pay taxes, and give them a path. Whatever that is to citizenship. To me, this is one of those things that makes absolutely no sense. But what we did is we expanded that to, you know, after the George Floyd event, we as a company kind of rally around,
Starting point is 00:54:35
we have to find opportunities into our inner cities and have used a lot of the same platform to broaden it. It's called Road to Higher, where Golden Door Scholars is a part of it. But here's something really cool. We start teaching coding in North Carolina, mostly black and brown students, mostly from title one schools. We're going to the high schools and start teaching there.
Starting point is 00:54:55
And then we do an apprenticeship program, and then we partner up with all the corporations in Charlotte. We are graduating more black and brown kids with computer science expertise than the whole North Carolina system is now This year we have over 220 of this kids graduating and they all have jobs on the other end So we give them an apprenticeship and then we have a whole the from these are high school or college They're not going to call these are kids that are 22 23 24 mostly black on brown kids that were teaching them how to code. We pay them to
Starting point is 00:55:26
teach their high school grads that didn't go to college. We give them a two year apprenticeship where we're paying them on behalf of all this corporation. It's working tremendously. Here's the crazy thing. This 21 year old kid who was driving over after two years of the apprenticeship, they are as competent in technology as someone who graduated from NC State. How do you think that can be scaled? What do you think is the magic in that that this is a great example of what we said earlier,
Starting point is 00:55:51
you can't solve that problem across the country, but can you provide a roadmap for that? You start with the jobs. And at the end of the day, there's hundreds of thousands of jobs that are unfilled because they don't have to scale. So pick this. By the way, it's the same thing with high school teachers today. There's a shortage of I believe is 300 and 50,000 teaching vacancies that is projected to be, but we get we pay 42,000 and most dates and it's a crazy, right? But keep on technology where there's the big gap. The reason our model works in Charlotte in North Carolina is because it writes in the rails of the system. Our model works in Charlotte, in North Carolina, is because it writes in the rails of the system. It literally partners with the county and with the city.
Starting point is 00:56:29
It partners with the schools, with the high school systems, all title one. It connects to the public school. So like, there is a lot here. And then the corporations all basically offer a job on the other end. The key to this is to start with the job and then train into the job versus start with education and hope to get a job So go fill the job that is not getting filled and by the way Solve the diversity challenge that all these corporations have solve a lot of the other issues But don't show up into the nonprofit arm of a corporation solve a problem that they really have and that's the connection
Starting point is 00:57:02
So I think it will have to happen more at the city level. So there's a big initiative, co-110, that a number of high-profile CEOs have built to try to do this. It just takes a long, long time. And my concern is when the economy turns, these are the kinds of things that get scrapped. These are the kinds of things that people stop giving that job for or investing in. Yet we go back to this negative spiral that we tend to have. Obviously you and I both are kind of cut from the same cloth, which is that of immigrants. And I think with that comes a little bit of disbelief as to why the US would not as a country want to embrace an amazing asset. Do you see this changing?
Starting point is 00:57:43
Do you see this as just being a season? I do. I'm super optimistic on our country. For us flawed as we are, I would rather be nowhere else. Yeah, I agree with that. And you know, there's just things unfortunately take time. You know, I'm reading a book called Brothers about the Kennedys and you'd realize that
Starting point is 00:58:02
there were real serious issues there around the mob and like all these things that we don't hear about today. So I do believe that the trend line is up. It's just not linear and it's not fast enough. And I think we just have more information, much of which, if not all of most of which is noise, that distracts us a little bit. I think back in the 60s, there's no question it was a more tumultuous era. I mean, there were political assassinations on US soil. We don't have anything like that today. Not going to.
Starting point is 00:58:35
But the noise today is unbearable. Yeah, it's unbearable. The never-ending cycle of nonsense, news, cable, social media, I think makes it feel more dramatic, but that could also be the undoing. You know, and these are pandalums. I think we're at a pendulum right now where the country is super divided. I believe that they will be as serious of leaders in our future that will bring us back
Starting point is 00:58:59
together. We need a common enemy. Maybe it is this risk of China that becomes our galvanizing thing. I find it super interesting when there's a real crisis in our country, 9-11, or even COVID at the beginning. We all behave like Americans. And then we need something that brings us back to being Americans and not Republicans or Democrats or Black or White and all that stuff.
Starting point is 00:59:23
And common enemy tends to do that. I think this peaceful times allow for a lot of room for us to subdivide. Let's pivot a little bit to talk about health, which is you're a very health conscious guy, but there's also been some changes, I think, in your life over the past. I think I've known you now for nine years. Basketball used to be kind of the only thing you did for exercise, which was great because it kept you running around a court, but you could be prone to injuries and things like that. How would you describe overall kind of your mentality towards your health, your
Starting point is 00:59:56
longevity, what changes have you made? One of my favorites, which I'm sure you'll get to, is your approach to your body weight, which cracks me up. I realize that I want to be here for as long as I can and I want to be here and as active of a way as I can. I'm committed to that, you know, it's this notion of time, but it's time on the other way. So for the first time ever in the last, you know, especially in the last four years,
Starting point is 01:00:18
I've gone into the gym and I have a trainer and we go through it. I don't do the crazy stuff you do, but I would argue that I am so much stronger from grip to balance to all the things. And I try my version of it. I don't consider myself to be an elite athlete in that regard, but I feel so much better. I transitioned from basketball, so I play my last official pick-up game about three
Starting point is 01:00:42
months ago and I had a bunch of pros come. And it was great because it's been such a great language for me and so many relationships came through basketball so much self learning and self awareness. And I now picked up tennis and you know, now why did you do that? Why did you completely stop playing your favorite sport? Because I watch a lot of people my age is blowing a killies in a knee and all of that and those are all signals that we should listen to I didn't want to get to that place and now the more I play that more my knees were sore and you know my body's talking to me It actually talks to us all the time and I wanted to leave on my terms and I wanted to leave knowing that it served its purpose
Starting point is 01:01:22
It doesn't control me. I picked up ten as an pandemic and it's something that we're doing more as a family, but love the apprenticeship, the struggle. So I have a coach, I go twice a week, it's a great work, I get my heart rate to 130 again to zone two, I stay there for an hour. So I get a lot of multiple values and I'm really not good. Footwork is different, everything is different, and I love the grinding of things. And it's a reminder of humility. Everything that we now take for granted that we think we're so good at at some point was
Starting point is 01:01:51
really, really hard. So I have now a list of things. It's embarrassing. I'm Puerto Rican. I don't know how to dance salsa. I can't die as the only Puerto Rican who can't dance salsa. So, last night you were grilling and I'm like, I used to grill a lot more. And so I have this notion now that I want to keep learning.
Starting point is 01:02:07
Things I have a list of about eight or nine things. And eventually if we end up living part of the years in another country, that language I want to try to engage in. And it's just this notion I don't want to get old not by my age, but I don't want to get old by stuff. I want to talk about that last game and pick up basketball. How sad was that? Zero.
Starting point is 01:02:26
Really? No, I'm grateful for what I had, not because it ended its life. The biggest self-growth I've had since the plane was in that middle bucket of like relationships. And what I realize, Peter, is that the most important relationship we have, the most important friend we have is ourselves. And that unless we get that right, everything else will have a lot of friction.
Starting point is 01:02:54
Everything else will be a worse version of what it can be. And what I've realized as I study this is that we in society, and it's almost every religion, and they say almost all because I don't know, but most religions that I know are anchor in some level of guilt and guilt as a way of teaching us or as keeping us connected to something. And I've realized that guilt is the most useless emotion one can have. And I have spent the last five years just basically getting rid of guilt. To the point that I joke that it's a complex I no longer suffer from. I still have others,
Starting point is 01:03:30
but I feel no guilt. And when you feel no guilt, what you realize is that you can change the dialogue that you have with yourself. I am super kind to myself. I constantly make mistakes. I constantly do things and I'm like, oh gosh, that wasn't right. Or I don't show up the way I need to show up. But I have nothing but love for myself. I would say, thanks. Yeah, that wasn't your best. Okay. Next one, it is. And help me understand that. So it's hard for me to imagine you showing up as poorly as I can. But let's say you, you're in sort of a pissy mood. You come home. You had asked your wife to do something earlier, it's not done, instead of saying,
Starting point is 01:04:07
hey, sweetie, did you have a chance to do that thing? I asked you to do before you sort of snip it. I don't know if you've ever done that. It happens, yes. Okay. How do you, I think it's really easy to feel bad and feel shame for snapping at her and then that actually impairs your next interaction.
Starting point is 01:04:23
But how do you break that cycle? I own it because it just takes a little bit of time. I'm sorry, I just took out something on you that it was not on you, that was unfair. I hope you forgive me. How long does it take you to man up to that? It's not long, 20 minutes 30 minute. Like you're very self-aware.
Starting point is 01:04:40
And you can read body language. You can see that what you just said kind of cut through it away. And then you're like, huh, what did I do? But more importantly is, I don't feel bad. I don't carry this notion of, oh my goodness, I just did this. Even if I do something that I didn't want to do, I just said, okay, it's part of being human.
Starting point is 01:04:58
It's part of growing up. It's part of learning. It's part of your humanity. But do you think that that can only happen because you're able to immediately make amends? I think it's a habit. We walk around. So how do you break that habit then? Guilt is a pretty strong habit for a number of people, I'm sure. Yeah. It's like any habit, and maybe you're worse than smoking. Smoking is hard. I never smoke, but it's a really habit. But if you want to break it, you break it. 98% of your thoughts are with yourself.
Starting point is 01:05:26
So first of all, you got to be very aware of all your thoughts. And you got to be able to objectivize what you're hearing. And you have to be able to evaluate and say, you know what, is this productive? Is this helping me? Or am I doing this because I've always done it? Or because this is how my parents kind of related to it? And I think the more we move away from the emotion of guilt
Starting point is 01:05:47
and it becomes self-love, it becomes a notion that the safest place for us to be is with ourselves and the kindest place to be is in our own heads and there's no judgment, there's no anything. Like life becomes so much simpler. And then that that you give yourself, you can give to others. You know, when we talk about purpose, we're very lucky that we can impact people through your platform, you're impacting lots of us. And, you know, I'm lucky that in my platform, I can impact
Starting point is 01:06:13
people, but you impact people every day with little things. How you shop to the coffee shop in the morning, the type of connection that you make, the taking time, like all of that is making an impact. And the more that you feel a the taking time, like all of that is making an impact. And the more that you feel a peace and style, the more you want to give it. So I am now addicted really to like good energy. And that doesn't mean it's maybe 95% of the time, but oh, I love that place. And I give it freely. And I give it with expecting nothing in return. And to me, this is like the happy place. I live in a happy place. We think it's the relationship between happiness and wealth. Do you think they're uncoupled?
Starting point is 01:06:52
Do you think they're correlated positively? Do you think they're correlated negatively? I think we decide what they are. Some of the happiest people in the world have no wealth, so they cannot be coupled. Now, wealth can give you a set of conveniences that allows you to solve for whatever your priorities are that may heighten your ability to do that and therefore gives you more happiness or like in many people, you pursue wealth your whole life because that's what our society wants and when you get there you just feel so empty and then you feel so guilty for all you sacrifice for it. And you're in the worst place, which is you got what you wanted and it was a mirage and it meant nothing. And there are so many people out there that feel like, oh my goodness, I was running the wrong race. You know, we talk a lot in life, Peter, around the best way to run a race.
Starting point is 01:07:44
around the best way to run a race. No one steps back and asks, am I running the right race? And I think really focusing on re-evaluating the race you're running. So when you ask me questions about, you know, red ventures in 10, 20 years, I made it very clear after my playing event that I was going to run at different races than everybody else. I wasn't looking for being public, I wasn't looking for being the wealthiest, I wasn't looking for my race was to enjoy the race. And to enjoy the race, I am crazy, so I love growing, I love being challenged, I love competing. I give no power to anybody, and I try really hard not to take power away from anybody.
Starting point is 01:08:20
What do you think are the ways that people even inadvertently take power away from people? You know, we as leaders can overlead and not let other people have, let them be celebrated and not take all the credit for things or on the contrary, take responsibility for things that may not have been truly your responsibility. So I think leaders have an ability to really manage the power equation with intentionality. I think how you treat somebody. We talked about this in the last conversation, but I think the best way we can parent is by showing our kids how to treat strangers and how we give people respect no matter who
Starting point is 01:09:00
they are or what they're doing. And how do we not give anybody too much respect just because society made them be something everybody puts their pants on the same way. Everybody has insecurities. Everybody has issues. When you look at people as like, you know, we all are in this imperfect journey with imperfections, it just makes it really level field and simpler. One of the really enjoyable, I mean, there were so many, but certainly one of the enjoyable highlights of the friend summit was when Simon Sinek got up and talked about finite versus infinite games, which of course is the name of a book. Maybe for folks that aren't
Starting point is 01:09:35
familiar with that, I know it's a book that you love as well. How do you implement that ethos into both your business and your life. You know, when Simon sent me an early book and said, hey, what do you think? It was almost like he was writing what, it was in my brain. I just don't have an ambeletric writer book, but he wrote a book.
Starting point is 01:09:56
I'm like, he actually was rewriting a book by somebody that had come before, yet put it in more modern terms. It became kind of codifying a language that I really believe in, and that the core of the infinite game is that there's a bunch of principles of the game and how you play the game and all of that,
Starting point is 01:10:12
but the core of the infinite game is that there's no winning, that the whole objective of the game is to stay in the game. The reality is, if you really read into it, the real, real, ultimate objective is not just to stay in the game, but to perpetuate the game. The reality is, if you really read into it, the real, real, ultimate objective is not just to stay in the game, but to perpetuate the game. So what you're doing through your podcasts, through your book that's coming out, through your kids, through everything else is you're perpetuating the game, you know, the game that matters to you. And that's living with purpose. Because you are now, you have a purpose of what you're doing.
Starting point is 01:10:45
I feel the same way. So when you give up the winning or losing, when you don't look at things, you give away a lot of the jealousy. Like I don't feel jealousy. It's an emotion that I am like just because you have it doesn't mean I don't have it. You know, maybe a little envious of time is like, wow, I wish I had the knowledge that Peter has about this stuff, but zero jealousy. So the infinite game, it makes it really, really simple not to get caught up on winning or
Starting point is 01:11:09
losing, just play the game. And therefore, get away from back to this notion of like, oh, I came in second, I came in third. And you and I have talked a lot about this kind of stuff. It's like, and by the way, I don't think it affects the outcome at all. Is that something that you have the luxury of playing because you run a private company, but if red ventures were a public company, would you be able to live by that or would quarterly earnings and other metrics that shareholders would be privy to and have an interest in change?
Starting point is 01:11:42
That one of the words, do public markets demand winning? and have an interest in change that. In other words, do public markets demand winning? I think by and large, yes. Now, you could argue that Jeff Bezos at Amazon forever never made money, even though the public markets were demanding that he did this and basically said, no, I'm gonna continue to lose money on you,
Starting point is 01:11:59
either looking at like my story or not. You could argue that Elon Musk is playing the infinite game in many ways with the decisions to make it even Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah, with meta. Like it clearly has lost 75% of the value of the company. So I think you can do it. You just have to have the temperament and the stomach to be unpopular. And you know what? The best way to be to not be unpopular is not to read. I don't read anything about us about me. It doesn't matter. The opinion of a stranger has zero value to me. Now, if you call me and say, dude,
Starting point is 01:12:33
I heard you say this or do this and that feels like not you, I will listen because I know that you know me and you care. I have no desire to be popular with people I don't know. I want to respect it by people that I care about. That's an amazing lesson. That, to me, is a very difficult feature of living in the world today. Do you look at what people are saying about you on social media? Do you read comments?
Starting point is 01:12:59
Not very often, but a little bit. I would say I'm probably 95% compliant with the notion of ignoring it. And when I do read it, I'm rarely perturbed by it, largely for the reasons that you put forth, which is you understand that it's kind of irrelevant. But I can't imagine what it would be like to be doing that from a real stage. Look, I'm kind of a nobody, but could you imagine being Mark Zuckerberg, for example? You know, I think he doesn't care. I think it's only relevant, Peter. There is no stage that is different
Starting point is 01:13:33
or bigger than ours. There is just different stages. Just because someone has a bigger platform than we do, doesn't make their stage more important than our point. Like, we're all the same. No, I think it just means that the attacks are louder, potentially. But doesn't matter if you don't read him, if you stay true to yourself, we're all the same. No, I think it just means that the attacks are louder potentially. But doesn't matter if you don't read them.
Starting point is 01:13:46
If you stay true to yourself, it was all circular logic. Have you imparted a lesson like this on your kids? We've talked about this a little bit on our first discussion. You made an interesting point that I've thought a lot about actually. I think I had historically thought of it as our kids have it so much easier than we did because we came from little, they come from plenty. I had historically thought of it as our kids have it so much easier than we did because we came from little, they come from plenty, reasons going on. I think you framed it this way, but this is certainly how I think about it is I feel
Starting point is 01:14:14
like me from my parents, from their parents, from their parents, there was an inevitable trend that the child would exceed the accomplishments of the parents. That was just the nature of moving from the industrial revolution to now. And maybe it's our kids that will be the first one for whom it's not just going to be falling off a log to exceed the accomplishments of their parents in whatever metric we use to think about that. And you came at that from a real point of empathy, which is, I want to make sure my kids aren't under some unnecessary, unrealistic pressure that they have to do something that their parents did. Say more about that and how is your thinking sharpened?
Starting point is 01:14:55
It stems from the premise, I think our kids have a lot more comfort. They have a lot more access. They have a lot more experiences, but that's different. If you're defining this about feeling a level of satisfaction with life or a level of happiness back to what we've been talking about, there's two separate things. They're divorced from one another.
Starting point is 01:15:19
I think the fact that we're starting with the premise that achieving more than your parents financially is the objective of life is like a goofy starting point. I think what I will love my kids is to feel like they were able, given the opportunity to really find their gift and to do it within a place of love and that they are great parents. And then as a result, we as a family did good in the world. And none of these things kind of make any sense. When people are like, oh, we don't know, we're, I just think it's hard. It's hard when you are Peter Atia's daughter or Peter Atia's sons.
Starting point is 01:15:53
And we should be mindful of that because it's a burden that it's put on them by others that they don't know how to accept. You know, that's what I really meant by that. I saw a really interesting clip. I'm sure we'll be able to find it for the show notes. It was Arnold Schwarzenegger, a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I'm guessing he would have been late 70s, early 80s. So I had already accomplished a lot, but obviously had more to accomplish, right? This is before he would
Starting point is 01:16:18
have become the world's biggest movie star and go on to become the governor. But he was being asked and I think it was like Barbara Walters. It was some high brow interview. So it must have been the 80s by this point. What accounts for your greatness? And he sort of said, look, to have this level, he's referring to his own level of drive, it must come from a place of hardship. He more, much more eloquently than this described that basically everything he has comes from a singular focus of Escaping and being better than and improving and he said look the reality of it is Kids who don't come for this if your kids don't come from this level of deprivation They can't be great. They can be very well adjusted and that's really the best thing you can hope for them
Starting point is 01:17:02
But they can't be great and I really thought about in one I was like that's really the best thing you can hope for them, but they can't be great. And I really thought about it on one, I was like, that's really interesting. There's a lot to reflect on there, because first of all, there's nothing wrong with being well adjusted. It could be a perfectly reasonable goal for kids who come from privilege, kids who are never to want anything
Starting point is 01:17:16
to be perfectly well adjusted, but he's arguing that's the best case scenario. Well, great in what? Great at lifting weights, great at being a movie star. Being exceptional. So that's different because you can be a great human being, being the elite 1% of something as a huge amount of tax on other things. Absolutely.
Starting point is 01:17:36
And I don't think, look, I mean, that's the irony I guess of his life is he couldn't see the crystal ball of the lows that would come with the highs. To me, that's the problem with hyper-successful people that trying to repeat what they did and ends up being more self-destructive than not. And I would argue that most people can't handle greatness because it is addictive. Greatness has reflected by being the best at something or the very best, so for a period of time. And those who are able to accept the fact that none of that matters, and it will change and evolve, live better lives.
Starting point is 01:18:08
What do you want for your kid to be the great? Is it something for a moment in time in miserable, or do you want him to be not self-adjusted because that to me is like a consolation price? I think being well-adjusted is a fantastic objective, frankly. Which actually, by the way, kind of is just a very extreme version of the Yin and the Yang between fluid and crystallized intelligence. The more extreme one is the harder, you know, the more extreme your fluid intelligence is,
Starting point is 01:18:34
it might be harder to make that transition to crystallized intelligence. And that's true in intelligence, but I think that's even more true in what does it like to be Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan? That's why I think really, really great, four-o-perfect students struggle to be super productive in life because they never had to deal with adversity. They never had to be coached.
Starting point is 01:18:56
They've never had to be in a place where they're forced to be good at it. It is better to struggle so that you learn to struggle than to be great at something. Because life is full of potential struggles. Well, Rick, as always, awesome to sit down and catch up on life. Congratulations on all of your successes in the past couple years in particular. And I'm really excited to hear about this museum in North Carolina. I think the next time I come out to visit you, I hope we can make the time to go and see it because I would actually love to see that.
Starting point is 01:19:26
No, I would love that Peter and I can't say enough to you. You've had an incredible impact on my knowledge of myself and exercise and nutrition and how I'm going to live. I know that the last ten years of my life, I should name that to you because it's helped me a lot and I love our friendship and I love how we can be so honest with each other and grow and I'm humble you would have me especially a second time.
