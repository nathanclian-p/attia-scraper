Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions I've gathered along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at peteratia-md.com.

On this episode, I interview my good friend Dominic Dagostino. Dom as he is known by his professor at the University of South Florida. His PhD is in neuroscience and that's where he got his background, but Dom is probably most recognizable to people listening to this because he is certainly one of the experts on ketosis. And that's in all variants of it. So starvation ketosis, nutritional ketosis, and in particular the use of exogenous ketones.
Starting point is 00:01:10
Gosh, Dom and I go way back. We met probably a little over five years ago and instantly formed a friendship around our obsessive end of one experiments, although I will say he is closer to winning a Darwin award on the basis of his and of ones than I am. Couple notes about this podcast first.
Starting point is 00:01:29
This is highly technical at times. And in fact, well time stamp it in the show notes, but I would say roughly the first hour is even a little more technical than I had intended to go. I think part of the issue is just once I get talking with Dom about this stuff, I couldn't stop asking him questions. And I think there were times when I guess we forgot we were recording a podcast and it was just us getting really technical. I don't think it's too technical to follow if you have some background understanding
Starting point is 00:01:55
about chemistry, but we'll do our best in these show notes to make sure that we're given even the recreational user necessary tools to follow this. Now that said, if you get 20 minutes into this thing and you're like, I don't understand what the hell these guys are talking about, do not hesitate to skip ahead. There's a lot of stuff that gets later on into the podcast, and this is a long podcast. It's nearly three hours.
Starting point is 00:02:15
There's a lot of stuff we get into at the end that I think will be kind of the stuff people really want to know, even if they don't want to get in the gory details. So, in particular, we talk very specifically about all of the ketones. And I'm getting a lot of questions about Peter. What's the difference between a ketone ester, a ketone salt, one of the mono esters, one of the diesters, where does MCT fit into this? What about the caprylic acid?
Starting point is 00:02:37
And how many should we be using this one versus this one? And what are the advantages, this measures? This is going to be your dissertation level course in that subject matter. The other thing that we get into at the very end, and we almost end on this, but again, look to the timestamps for exactly where it is, is we get into what I consider one of the most interesting discussions I've ever had on what I sort of loosely describe as a metabolic oncologist playbook. So when I asked Dom about this, he had just some of the most interesting insights. And I was really impressed by the breadth and the organization of his thinking around this. Now, I want to point out something here. And I say it in
Starting point is 00:03:15
the show, but it's really important for me to caveat this here. This cannot be construed as medical advice. Dom is not a medical doctor. He doesn't pretend to be one on TV. He is a research scientist who focuses on basic and translational research. He collaborates with lots of physicians. He is involved in a number of clinical trials, but ultimately, Dom is not offering medical advice. And frankly, nor is anybody or nor should anybody be on a podcast. So this information I asked because I get asked this stuff a lot. And frankly, I don't know enough about this sort of outreaching and outlying metabolic therapies out there. But I hope that if people are listening to this and they're afflicted by cancer, which
Starting point is 00:03:56
statistically speaking is obviously going to happen, given that one of six people are going to get cancer in their lifetime, I hope that if some of this stuff does scratch someone's sort of desired to understand more, that they can use some of the resources we're going to link to to potentially identify the right places where either clinical trial will be taking place or they could at least pursue some of these things under the appropriate medical guidance. I could go on and on about other nets and gnats in here, but honestly, I think the best thing to do right now is probably pay a little bit of attention, maybe more than usual to the show notes. Treat this as little bit like a buffet, go to the places you want to go to. Of course, I would recommend
Starting point is 00:04:32
the entire thing if you really have an interest in this subject matter. And I hope that this podcast is going to answer many of the questions that I see people asking out there. I actually learned quite a bit on this, and I tend to know the subject matter reasonably well. So without any further delay, welcome to the podcast with Dominic DeGasino. Hey, Dom. Hey Pete. How are you, man?
Starting point is 00:04:56
I'm doing well. How are you? I'm doing really well, and I'm really grateful for you making the trip all the way up here. I know that in part you're visiting family, but it's great that you've carved out time to come from New Jersey all the way up to the lovely city of Manhattan. I appreciate the invite and love being here.
Starting point is 00:05:14
I love the visit. Well, there's going to be a number of people listening to this today who are already incredibly familiar with who you are, the work you've done. I certainly consider you probably one of the two most authoritative persons on the subject we're going to get into today. But for anybody who's listening to this, who is not entirely familiar with you, I suspect by the end of today, they're going to want to get a lot more familiar with you. So I actually remember the day we met and it's kind of funny. I was in Florida giving that talk at IHMC and I knew of you by name, but
Starting point is 00:05:47
I didn't know who you were or what you looked like. So I wouldn't have recognized you. And I gave a talk. This would have been 2011 maybe, maybe 2012. And at the end of the talk, there was like a Q&A. And you know, it was a long Q&A and it just went on and on and on. And then you asked a question. Now now I wish I could say I remember the question, but I knew from the question that that guy knows what he's talking about. And then of course, Ken Ford, who knew us both, had basically arranged for us to all have dinner that night. And so that was the night we met. And it was really at least from my standpoint, not to embarrass you. It was like a love at first sight. Like I was like, I was just so giddy to be able
Starting point is 00:06:28
to sit there and have dinner with you. The same, same here. Yeah, I knew who you were. And I was looking for that talk. I made the drive up there. And I felt like we were connected before we even connected, you know, or definitely on the same wavelength on the stuff.
Starting point is 00:06:41
Yeah, you've got such an interesting history that we're gonna get into about how you got interested in this space. But also, I got such an interesting history that we're going to get into about how you got interested in this space, but also I think one of the things that many people might not appreciate fully, that I appreciated just because of the convenience and luxury of how we met was just your interest in self-experimentation as well. And sometimes when you're studying something or interested in something that is not entirely main stream yet, you have to bootstrap it and you have to look at
Starting point is 00:07:07
like limited amounts of animal data, limited amounts of in vitro data and then sometimes combine it with insights that you get through early experimentation on yourself. Absolutely, so I immerse myself in what I'm doing. I think that's sort of what we can do. That's how we learn, yeah, that's really, that's the best way to learn.
Starting point is 00:07:24
So you did your PhD in neuroscience, correct? Yeah, so what was your physiology? And physiology, so you're finishing your PhD and you're planning to do a postdoc? Yeah, I did it in the neural control of autonomic regulation. So the brainstem mechanisms sort of sense O2, oxygen and CO2, and modulate respiratory rhythm generation, and also cardiovascular
Starting point is 00:07:47
sympathetic tone to the heart, like those neurons, and how they sense oxygen. During my PhD, I got interested in diving physiology, and it was amazing to me that we don't really understand how our brains and our physiology functions in extreme environments as it pertains to elevated hyperberec pressure, elevated oxygen, CO2, anesthetic gases, for example. We know the anesthetic potency of a gas is proportional to its ellipid solubility, but we don't really know what that means. Like, why what's happening at the level of the membrane of the mitochondria? So my postdoctoral fellowship was actually developing technologies to study that and that would be hyperbaric atomic force microscopy and that was like That's what I just delved into for
Starting point is 00:08:31
So how does that work? So I know what hyperbaric means. I know what my cross-copy means Tell me about the part about the force The first term for atomic force microscopy was a scanning probe microscopy Okay, and instead of using light or electrons it uses a a very sharp tip probe atomic force microscopy was a scanning probe microscopy. Okay. And instead of using light or electrons, it uses a very sharp tip probe that can be so sharp it's monoatomic. And it essentially raster scans across the sample
Starting point is 00:08:57
and can detect very subtle changes in the topography of the sample that you're scanning. Right? So it actually spawned the whole nanotechnology world. So this particular instrument was used to characterize materials and really help develop Silicon Valley in many ways. And it's a microscope that we took basically
Starting point is 00:09:19
an off-the-shelf atomic force microscope that gives you the scanning resolution of an electron microscope, but also has a capacity to image living cells. And took this technology and put it inside an environmental chamber, a hyperbaric chamber. And part of my project was doing the electrical, the fluid, and the gas penetrations to make the thing functional. And also doing a series of studies and calibration tests to determine that we could reliably make hyperbaric atomic force microscopy measurements inside
Starting point is 00:09:51
this chamber. And with this technology, it gives us insight at the nanoscopic level of what's happening to the mitochondria, to the cell membrane. So I got a grant through the Department of Defense, which they give these equipment grants to develop this technology and also grant to use it and then later another grant to put a confocal microscope. You might have heard of a laser scanning. I actually used a confocal microscope in my undergrad thesis to do optional optical sectioning
Starting point is 00:10:22
of terms. I know, because I was an engineer. So I was interested in a question of, did the direction of extrusion that you put on a tibial plateau? So when you do joint replacements, does the direction in which you extrude what's called ultra-hymolycular white polyethylene
Starting point is 00:10:37
does that predict its fracture? And it turned out it did, but the tool to help us measure that was this confocal microscope. So that was my introduction to high end microscopy. It's an amazing tool. Yeah, so the second- Everyone should have one, right?
Starting point is 00:10:51
Yeah, you got it. They're the toys that we have in the lab. So that was the next phase of sort of my experiments was installing a laser-scanning confocal. So we could optically section individual cells and look at the mitochondria inside the cells under great levels of oxygen and hyperbaric pressure, essentially, pressure of an inert gas, like helium, nitrogen. So to simulate, for example, a Navy SEAL dive or a deep sea dive. And in the context of developing this technology and imaging, a wide variety of cells from primary neurons to alleleblastoma cells,
Starting point is 00:11:26
to human dermal fiberglass, smooth muscle cells. I noticed that cancer cells would produce proportionally more superoxid anion, which is the precursor, oxygen, free radical that comes from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as a consequence of normal metabolism. And the cancer cells looked to have what appeared to be their chock full of mitochondria, and they were moving around very dynamic structures. And under normal levels of oxygen, they kind of produced a normal level of superoxid anion or oxygen free radicals.
Starting point is 00:12:01
But when we hit the cancer cells with hyperbaric oxygen, the superoxide production went off the charts. And it was very apparent to me that they were producing excess free radicals, and as we made measurements over time, it was very apparent that it was accelerating membrane lipid proxidation, which we use a variety of tests. One is a T-MARIS test where we look at malindialdehyde production, and the technology, the atomic force microscopy allows us to look at very subtle changes of the surface of the membrane. You measure the perturbations
Starting point is 00:12:37
on the surface of the membrane and nanoscopic changes, and we look at membrane roughness, and you could look at the roughness of the membrane and calculate that, and that can correlate to membrane lipid peroxidation, and it correlates the numbers correlate well. So what you're looking at is the physical correlate of membrane lipid peroxidation when you capture that data with atomic force microscopy. Is that clear?
Starting point is 00:13:03
Yeah, let me back up and make sure I can disagree this into steps. So the first thing that you notice is lots of mitochondria in cancer cells. And these are what types of cancer lines. The main one that I was working with that I ended up publishing the paper neuroscience with was U87 glioblastoma cells.
Starting point is 00:13:20
And they're taken out of like a 44 year old paper. So human cell lines. Human cell line. Yeah cell line, yeah. A lot of people use it, you know. And these are astrocytes, right? These are not neurons. Yeah, of a glial origin. Yes, yes.
Starting point is 00:13:32
So observation one, lots of mitochondria, okay? Good to know, because obviously there's an understanding that Warburg pointed out that says, hey, like, you know, these things largely are anaerobic, not aerobic, so they shouldn't really need much mitochondria. Yeah. And then what you're saying is you put them into a hyperbaric environment and how hyperbaric, how many times atmospheric pressure would you need?
Starting point is 00:13:52
I saw the observation at, so normal oxygen is 0.2 ATA. We say, at, at, at, at, at, at, absolute. And it saw a big jump up in superoxide anion production at 0.95. So carcinogenic? That's almost five times atmospheric pressure. That's almost five times, yeah. And actually 0.95, if your breathing produces a PO2 in the brain, if similar to breathing 2.5 atmospheres of oxygen,
Starting point is 00:14:20
and then I actually went up to the experiment with 3.25 atmospheres of oxygen. That basically was cooking the cells from the inside out. The mitochondria were producing so much oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species. So superoxidant anion can go to hydroxyl radical through the fentanyl reaction through hydrogen peroxide. That can be driven in different ways. I basically saw the mitochondria exploding under hyperbaric oxygen conditions.
Starting point is 00:14:48
And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before.
Starting point is 00:14:56
And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before.
Starting point is 00:15:04
And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. And I had never seen that before. cells I was looking at in primary cortical neurons, primary hippocampal neurons. At the time, I was just basically looking at, I was doing these experiments to validate the tool that we had just built. So no one actually had imaged living cells under hyperbareic conditions because no one had a hyperbareic microscope before. So I didn't actually know what I was even looking at. I was not a cancer biologist. I knew that cancer cells were rapidly proliferating,
Starting point is 00:15:27
so they probably had amped up metabolism, but it was just a very interesting observation to me. It was very interesting that they were also dying, and I figured cancer cells should be hardy, and you should be able to throw everything, but the kitchen sink at them and they should live. And then when I saw them, basically the mitochondria exploding and the membrane starting to become
Starting point is 00:15:46
permeable in necrotic cell death, I became more and more interested in that. We ended up publishing the observation. But I didn't actually know what it meant. I published it more like here, I built this cool tool and we did this experiment. I was actually just looking at the cell line as a model system to study reactive oxygen species and oxygen toxicity seizures, because part of the military was funding me to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms
Starting point is 00:16:16
of oxygen toxicity seizures. And it's thought that high levels of oxygen creates oxidative stress, and that perturbs the brain in a way that causes these grand-moutonic clonic seizures and we're developing tools. You can't understand it unless you know fundamentally what's happening at the level of the cell and the mitochondria. So I want to come back to that because that now makes sense for why diving could increase that risk because if you're using an oxygen
Starting point is 00:16:43
rebreather you're getting a higher concentration of oxygen and then you're under multiple atmospheres of pressure. You now basically replicated in a person what you were seeing as cell. But going back to the cell thing for a sec, do the free radicals that get generated destroy other cells beyond the cell that is generating the free radical, or is the problem largely contained to the cell? It's a dose-dependent phenomenon, right? And we were studying cells in this particular experiment in a petri dish or on a cover slip. So, yeah, it's sort of like an intact neural network or cellular network, so the cells
Starting point is 00:17:22
are literally connected to one another. Unlike a tissue cell, it's where you have an intact cytoearchitecture, which that's a little bit different But the oxygen free radicals and the substances that the cells produce do actually influence other cells adjacent to it or juxtapose to it That's obvious from some of the experiments we do in cell signaling You know if one cell becomes some of the experiments we do in cell signaling. You know, if one cell becomes permeable and we could detect cell death with various molecules like a thinium homodymer one, when that cell dies, it can stimulate excitotoxic events in surrounding cells. Same thing happens with the cancer cells.
Starting point is 00:17:58
It's obvious that cancer cells use reactive oxygen species for growth and proliferation, and I know this is something that may be contradicting to many people. We view free radicals as something that's damaging that the cell needs to get rid of, but they're very powerful signaling molecules, especially for cancer cells and growth and proliferation and in normal tissues. And do you mean nuclear signaling? In nuclear signaling and activation of transcription factors. Basically, there are many eye study as neuroscientists, eye study, redox sensitive ion channels. So the redox state of an ion channel can dictate the permeability and the gating functions
Starting point is 00:18:36
of that ion channel, which is intimately linked to cellular excitability by influencing the resting membrane potential. So as a neuroscientist, you know, you can study a very particular and cells have hundreds of thousands of ion channels, specific ion channels that are redox regulated. But what was obvious is that cancer cells have elevated rates of reactivoxin species that they use for growth and proliferation and also fuels metastasis and invasiveness to cancer cells.
Starting point is 00:19:06
And because they overproduce oxygen free radicals in the context of high oxygen, you can push the cells above their antioxidant potential and then trigger apoptosis. So it's like a double-edged sword. It's basically a U-shaped curve or invert, depending on how you want to think about it, where the cancer cell is not only afterbysed or revived, it's optimized to thrive at a certain level of elevated reactivative oxygen. An elevated level. But if you go too far, it becomes counter.
Starting point is 00:19:36
Yeah. So they have elevated endogenous antioxidant capacity, right? But because their mitochondria are defective in many ways and there's that term is kind of controversial. Some people think the warberg effect definitely endows the cells many benefits, but the aberrant activity of the mitochondria is creating this excess free radicals and hyperbaric oxygen and chemotherapy drugs that augment oxidative stress are therapeutic modalities that can be used. It was very apparent to me seeing that in a hyperbaric chamber looking at a microscope looking at these cells.
Starting point is 00:20:13
And no one had seen it before because no one had hyperbaric microscopy. Yeah. And that kind of, at the same time, I was growing these cells under different conditions. I was very interested in lactate. And I became interested in ketones too, just not for this reason. I was not yet interested in the ketogenic diet. I was looking at it for a different reason, actually. But I noticed that the cancer cells were not growing as rapidly as they should in the context of one, two, and five millimolar of beta hydroxybutyrate, which
Starting point is 00:20:46
I was growing them in. And I thought the lab tech may have been doing something that was influencing, but she assured me it wasn't. So we would pull the media off and put regular media on without the ketones and the cancer cells would start growing rapidly. Why were you using ketones in the media? Well, I was looking at a variety of different substrates back in 2008 and nine. I see. So you were just saying lactate glucose, BHB.
Starting point is 00:21:09
Yeah. 2 deoxyglucose. Yeah. Lactate. I was using a variety of different, and ketones were like, well, let's just see what ketones do. You know, that ketones were something that the body would produce in fasting, but I didn't, I didn't even know the anti-seizure properties of the ketogenic diet. I just thought of it as like what do brains, and a couple odd papers I came out like ketones could be used as fuel. I was very interested in alpha-L polylactate, various forms of lactate that could be used to preserve brain energy metabolism in the face of oxidative stress. And the ketones just, they sort of shined. So basically what they were able
Starting point is 00:21:47
to do was allow the neurons to preserve their membrane potential and normal cellular function, even in the context of extreme oxidative stress. And it made sense, right? Because the ketogenic diet, you know, I started looking more into this and discovered that the ketogenic diet, I started looking more into this and discovered that the ketogenic diet was a very effective anti-seizure strategy even when drugs fail. About two-thirds of patients respond favorably. You get 10 or 15% or super responders that never have seizures again. You can get them off your meds. It was probably working through a mechanism independent of any anti-seusure compound because the key to giant diet worked when drugs failed, you know, suggesting it was working
Starting point is 00:22:28
through a different mechanism or many mechanisms kind of in synchrony. So the tools that we developed really sort of started to allow us to understand from a cellular and molecular mechanism how ketones were working. And I was looking at other compounds at the time, but it's just as I kept studying, I was looking at sigma receptor agonist. I was looking at other antioxidants, many different antioxidants and combinations of antioxidants that were catalyzed mimetics, superoxidizmitex,
Starting point is 00:22:59
mimetics, you know, all these things that were in theory, they should work really well, but nothing was really working as well as ketones. And it also motivated me because when I discovered the ketogenic diet was a grossly underutilized, anti-seizure strategy, I was like, wow, I could go back to my nutrition roots. Because when I was undergrad, I majored in nutrition science. But I didn't pursue a PhD in nutrition because nutrition was not like a real science.
Starting point is 00:23:27
Like there was no jobs in nutrition. And the 90s was a decade of the brain. So it was like, let me try to get into a cellular neuroscience program. So I kind of just left nutrition. And this was my opportunity to bring nutrition back into my research projects into the lab. But my going back to that BHB in the media. Yeah. Did you have the same amount of glucose in as you had in the BHB free media?
Starting point is 00:23:52
Yeah, so we did everything in the context of the same amount of glucose. Another round five millimeter. Benefit was from the addition of BHB, not the reduction of glucose? Absolutely, yep. And as I started to get into the literature and read into this a little bit more, we started doing glucose subtraction and adding ketones and saw that normal healthy neurons functioned and thrived in a low glucose environment if the ketones were present, but the cancer cells would die. And this was also replicated and published
Starting point is 00:24:27
in various neuroblastoma cell lines. And I think Skinner was one person that published. And I found that he was at University of Florida, but he was a fellow and just had to left the school at the time. And then I went up there and gave a talk, I think, in 2010. And that further, that got me more and more interested in studying cancer, even though it was not
Starting point is 00:24:52
funded to do so. It was like this pet project that was completely very intellectually stimulating to me. And something that I could not just shelf and come back to at a later time. I had to, I felt like the environment was kind of hot for this. So I just kept reaching out to different scientists and showing them my data and asking them to explain it, like top level cancer biologists, and then I stumbled across Tom Seiford actually. Speculating, why do you think Tom was one of the few people that latched onto this? Was it simply because he'd already been thinking the same things or because it's
Starting point is 00:25:25
really, it is interesting when you think about how many really interesting and impressive people in cancer have not sort of come around to thinking about this stuff. Now in 2009, I think it was 2009 and I'm sure you have read this paper a thousand times. It's sort of, I think it was the first obvious mainstream view of this was the Matt Van Erheiden, Lou Cantley, Greg Thompson, science paper. Was that 09? Does that sound about right?
Starting point is 00:25:49
Which reminded me of that a couple papers around that time, which one was it? Well, this is the one that offered an explanation for the Warburg effect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Warburg was bio-synthetic. That's right, it was. Expanding the biomass, directing the tablets to do that.
Starting point is 00:26:03
Yeah, and that was interesting because that's a different explanation than presumably Tom would offer, right? It's accepting the Warburg effect is very powerful, but the question that Tom has really set out to address, no one is arguing the Warburg effect is present. The present, but the initiation of the warberg effect that damaged mitochondrial respiration causes an energetic crisis that kicks on the aacho genes that basically turn on the genes that are the essence of the warberg effect.
Starting point is 00:26:39
Let's describe the example. I should, I'm going to take for granted that everyone listening knows what the warberg effect is. So, for someone who doesn't know, how would you explain the warberg effect? The warberg effect simply stated is insufficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, or what we call respiration, with compensatory fermentation in the form of establishing, the cell establishes its energy, its production of ATP, our energy currency through glycolysis and substrate level phosphorylation. And it's well recognized that cancer cells, 90% of them, I would say, have a warburg phenotype,
Starting point is 00:27:22
meaning that they have highly accelerated like halicis and substrate level phosphorylation. So let me simple her that a little bit more. Our cells can turn glucose into something called pyruvate, and that occurs outside of the mitochondria. And that's not a highly energy efficient process. It doesn't generate much ATP. You then have a decision to make as a cell, which is basically how quickly does the body want ATP, and as a general rule, when it wants it quickly, it's an anaerobic environment. You think about things that drive quick ATP requirement. And so then it will just say, look, we'll just turn this peruvian into lactate. That's the glycolytic pathway,
Starting point is 00:28:02
which is not particularly efficient either. It doesn't generate that much more ATP, but it has the luxury of saying, I can guarantee to do this quickly and I don't need to be limited by cellular oxygen. Under ideal circumstances, you would want to generate the most ATP, you would shuttle that pyruvate into the mitochondria as a Cedal CoA, and you have this other process. So what you're saying is the Warburg effect is, hey, even under conditions at rest, a cancer cell seems to disproportionately do this glycolytic thing, and it generates its ATP that way
Starting point is 00:28:35
as opposed to going into the mitochondria. Exactly. Even in the presence of normal oxygen, it utilizes glycolysis and pumps out lactate. So under no other conditions do normal cells ferment and pump out lactate. So then- Now, Warburg, did he want a Nobel Prize for this observation? He want a Nobel Prize, yeah, for his work in metabolism, cancer cells, yeah.
Starting point is 00:28:59
And it was, is more kind of appreciated a little bit later what the implications of this was, but it was part of his Nobel Prize, yeah. You know, I remember reading an article about this once that has since escaped me, but then maybe I'm wrong, so correct me, but one of the reasons that the hypothesis was, because this was in the 1920s, if I recall.
Starting point is 00:29:17
Yeah, at least. That war was, yeah. So one of the reasons that this sort of got discarded for lack of a better word or at least ignored was people tended to focus on the exceptions. And there were exceptions, right? Certain lung cancers certainly seemed to pose an exception to the warburger effect.
Starting point is 00:29:30
And so the idea was, well, look, if you have an exception, then the rule is not so much a rule anymore. And is there another reason why the warburger effect was largely ignored for, you know, a generation and a half to two generations? Travis Christopherson wrote a book called Tripping Over the Truth that nicely sums that up. I think there's a lot of reasons for that, but I think the big focus was on understanding the gene pathways that were associated with carcinogenesis and that if we can understand the gene etiology of cancers and different types of cancers, then that would
Starting point is 00:30:04
explain cancer in a much more fundamental level. And that is the case. There is a dynamic interplay between metabolism and genetics. So now we have an appreciation that metabolites, you could call them an ancho metabolites, are epigenetic drivers. And metabolism is just not something, it's just not producing ATP. There are so many different intermediates and redox signaling and so many different signaling
Starting point is 00:30:34
molecules from metabolism that have epigenetic regulation. And I think that has become, when I got into this, there was no cancer metabolism conferences. And now there's a dozen or more where Lou Cantley is a keynote speaker and Craig Thompson is gay. And this has all sort of exploded shortly after some of these observations that I made. And it's just, I don't think it's coincidence.
Starting point is 00:30:59
I think. Do you remember that night? Yeah, yeah, I remember when we had that dinner in DC at that conference. Georgetown, yeah. I still look back at that Is one of the most remarkable rooms to be sitting in as a fly on the wall because there was only about 12 people there Yeah, and you know you had Lou Cantley you had Michael Bishop Steve Rosenberg David Sabotini Who else was there Michael Pollockock. A Vanderhide and... Yep, Matthew Vanderhide.
Starting point is 00:31:25
I mean, you basically had some of the most thoughtful cancer scientists in the world, certainly in the United States in one room, and that was an amazing conversation. That was great conversation. Yeah, yeah, that was... If I could go back in time, I'd take that.
Starting point is 00:31:39
Exactly, that was gold. We'll talk those guys into getting in a room again. I mean, I think what you're basically saying is, look, part of its reason for being discarded, or at least forgotten about, was a new sexier idea emerged, which is, hey, we started to understand the role of the genome. And there's this weird sort of debate you hear in the book. And then the observation that things like viruses,
Starting point is 00:31:59
which could encode and change our DNA. But the viruses that cause cancer are the very same viruses that damage the mitochondria, that damage the DNA and the mitochondria, and causing respiratory insufficiency, which triggers an energetic crisis, which can trigger the activation of oncogene through retrograde response.
Starting point is 00:32:18
So that needs to be appreciated too, but through this explosion of technologies that allowed us to understand genetics, and that was sort of being leveraged to really delve into cancer, I think. There was some politics influencing that too. So was the first thing you did from that point, because there's really two separate problems that you're talking about, the first is, why are these seizures occurring? And I'm referring very specifically to your DARPA-funded work, which was, why is it that when these special
Starting point is 00:32:50
forces guys are doing their ultra-secret dives, which require re-breathers, why are a subset of them having these fatal seizures? Well, it's the Office of Navy Research. So there's also DARPA. Okay, DARPA was doing DARPA. They were doing warfighter performance, actually, with Well, it's the office of Navy research. Oh, it was. There's also a dark, but okay. The dark probably is doing separate. Okay. They were doing warfighter performance. Got it. Okay.
Starting point is 00:33:08
With ketone extras, just prior to, you know, what I was doing. So that's one problem. Yeah. I mean, the other problem that you've also articulated is, hey, what's going on with cancer? Yes. Yes. So oxygen toxicity seizures are a limitation for Navy SEAL divers, and we don't know how to predict them or prevent them.
Starting point is 00:33:27
It's also a limitation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, right? So if you have carbon dioxide poisoning, right, and you need to live, essentially, you need to get that, that carbon dioxide off your hemoglobin, you need to basically increase the PO2 in your tissues and do that as fast as possible. Oh, because carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity than oxygen for hemoglobin, so you have to basically out-compete it. Yes, so if you were to take a ketone ester, which we know now, increase your resistance to oxygen toxicity by like 600 percent, and take a ketone ester and then get inside
Starting point is 00:33:59
a hyperburet chamber, you have a much greater chance of living. If you have wounds, there's 14 different applications for hyperburet oxygen therapy. We think that therapeutic ketosis strategy would make it much safer and more efficacious. So in the context of an oxygenary breather, the advantage is that there's a stealth component because you don't produce bubbles. You can dive in a quiet lake and go all the way across and surprise your enemy. But it's just 50 feet of sea water within 10 minutes at 50 feet of sea water, you run the risk of getting oxygen toxicity seizures. That's pretty shallow.
Starting point is 00:34:31
Well, I'd say that again. At 50 feet. 50 feet of sea water. In 10 minutes? You're on a dragrary breather according to the oxygen dive tables that has been enough to trigger seizure in many guys. So that produces a P02 in your brain
Starting point is 00:34:45
of about roughly 2,000 times higher than what your oxygen level in your brain would be right now, 2,000 percent higher. Yeah, so that needs to be sort of appreciated. And of course, it could all be averted if you just stick to the dive tables, right? But if you have, you know, enemy fire with 50 caliber machine guns coming down on you and you want to stay down, if the water's clear, you got to go down deeper. If you have a plan of mind and get to the bottom of a ship or
Starting point is 00:35:13
bridge, you might be underwater for three or four hours and the enemy is still up there and it's, you got to get down there and do your job and dive deep and avoid that. And then, you know, after a time, you have pulmonary oxygen toxicity too, if you're down there long enough. But generally speaking, these are breathers for shallow diving, but situations where they need to go down deeper. Do you have an estimate of how many Navy divers just in the United States, both in training or combat, would die in a given year from this or be injured?
Starting point is 00:35:44
It's pretty rare. Fortunately fortunately it's pretty rare. And if they do get hit with oxygen, our friend Kurparsli will tell you that Navy SEALs notorious about not telling what their issues are with their health. So if they do have a seizure, they would be kicked out. A lot of these guys, because that may make them a weak link that they're vulnerable. So we know recreational divers that push the limit who have been hit a couple times, you know, with this. And we're doing some studies right now, recreational divers.
Starting point is 00:36:14
So it's very under reported, but studies have shown, I always show a video in one of my talks of a guy in a chamber where he has a mask on and the mask is breathing 100% oxygen and the guy inside the chamber is breathing hyperbaric air. And within at 2.7 atmospheres of oxygen, he gets hit with a seizure and has a really violent tonic-clonic seizure. And it's stopped as soon as you remove the oxygen mask and start breathing air, even if it's at the same barometric pressure, the seizure stop. So one of the beneficial things of these seizures, if you want to, if there's a beneficial component to it, is that they quickly stop as soon as you remove the hyperbaric oxygen source, or you go from breathing 100% oxygen to hyperbaric air.
Starting point is 00:37:03
So what's happening is that the high levels of oxygen are creating oxidative stress and actually impeding various metabolic processes in the brain. And the brain is becoming hyper excitable. And the neurons are firing so many action potentials that the cells essentially can't maintain their membrane potential. And you get excitotoxicity that causes mass firing in the neurons and a seizure, right? And this is obviously under a very superphysiologic condition.
Starting point is 00:37:33
Superphysiologic. It only happens, you know, in these extreme environments of pressures and the reason for it now is kind of you have SNI trosylation of glutamic acid decarboxylase. There's two different isozymes and then what we think now is that you have more glutamate to GABA ratio. So, the enzyme that converts our GABA immunopatoric acid is actually created from glutamate, right? I got it. So, you have much more excitatory than inhibitory neurotransmitter. So, that ratio changes and it's a redox dependent reaction. Actually, it's a, you have estenitrosylation of this enzyme that converts more glutamate to GABA. So you have
Starting point is 00:38:15
increased neuronal firing and increased release of glutamate and also less conversion of the glutamate to GABA, which has a brain stabilizing effect., this is going off topic for just a second, but we know that as people age, we see greater and greater oxidative damage. So we see, you know, this susceptibility to ROS going up, does any of what you learned in this superphysiologic environment, where in a very short period of time, you're going to generate a ton of Ross by exposing someone to high pressure and high O2. Does anything you learned in that environment offer an insight into non-superphysiologic or normal aging and disease progression?
Starting point is 00:38:55
Yeah, I think in many different ways. So it's almost like exercise, right? If you exercise intensely, your reactive oxygen species are going to go up, inflammation, all these things kick on. So high pressure oxygen increases oxidative stress and that kicks on many different processes that can endow the cell with greater cellular protection. So it can, for example, cause an increase in superoxide dismutease. It can enhance, enhance our antioxidant defenses.
Starting point is 00:39:26
So the oxidative stimulus is a trigger for adaptive processes that can allow our systems to be more resilient against the same level of oxidative stress. This happens very robustly in a young animal and is significantly attenuated in an older animal. And I think that needs to be appreciated. So the adaptive response to the stimulus is varies genetically, probably between the individual. There's a lot of individual variability between people. And even if you take the same person under different conditions, whether it be if they're sleep deprived, what they ate that day, they're maybe if they're dealing with a little viral illness or something, their susceptibility to oxygen toxicity seizures
Starting point is 00:40:15
can be greatly affected by a lot of different variables. But that adaptive response, so we know hyperbaric oxygen stimulates the production of stem cells as much as something like GMCSF, like Nupogen or Luchine, like it's that powerful. It causes the production and the release of stem cells, which kind of hone in on sites of injury and aid in repair. So that's why it's most utilized application is actually for enhancing wound production or wound healing effects.
Starting point is 00:40:47
I see. You mentioned that there were 14 approved applications. I wasn't aware that there were that many. I certainly. I think it's 15 now. So what are some of the others? You're not to put you on the spot to rattle off all 15, but we can look it up. But just on the top of your head, what other ones do you know?
Starting point is 00:41:00
Yeah. Radiation necrosis. So for cancer, if you are getting radiation therapy for cancer, it is FDA approved for that. So if you have patients who's have radiation therapy, of course, there's decompression sickness. So we're recreational diving. If you get bent, another term for bent
Starting point is 00:41:17
is decompression, you know, it's the same deal. It's basically get the nitrogen out by basically you know, just nitrogen out. Yeah. Beating it out with oxygen. Yeah, carbon dioxide. Obviously, diabetic wounds, all the
Starting point is 00:41:30
hyperbaric, the UHMS, so hyperbaric medicine society approves the facilities. And I would say 90 plus percent of their revenue generated from that is diabetic wounds, which is a huge problem. Like you probably, in your practice, you probably see people with wounds that just don't heal. Well, I don't see them in my practice, but I certainly cut my teeth on it during residency,
Starting point is 00:41:54
no pun intended, significant problem. Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's a few different applications. And there's a lot of sort of rare things, there's noise induced hearing loss. If you use, that's one of the newer applications. That could be some things that are kind of counterintuitive. So when we think of high pressure oxygen, a lot of times you think of retinopathy or pre-matured. If you put a newborn and give them high levels of oxygen, you could cause them to go blind. A newborn. So that's an interesting...
Starting point is 00:42:22
Meaning a newborn is more susceptible to oxygen. It was a very common I guess you could say to put newborns on high levels of oxygen if they're born premature. And what is it about the newborn that makes them more susceptible? The development of their lungs. Is it the angiogenic component of this? Yes. Yes, that could be a component too. And maybe they just don't have the robust and dodged antioxidant capacity. But probably it might be the could be a component too. And maybe they just don't have the robust and dodged just antioxidant capacity, but probably it might be the angiogenic component too. Do you know if the top of your head
Starting point is 00:42:51
have elevated mercury or mercury toxicity as an indication for hyperbaric? Because I've heard of a lot of people doing this, but it strikes me as a little bit off-label. There's so much off-label stuff being done. So one of the things that I'm really interested in testing is for traumatic brain injury. And I do think that low levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, if used shortly after a traumatic brain injury,
Starting point is 00:43:16
I think the faster you restore oxygenation, the more likely you are to salvage those neurons. So, ideally, you want to treat with something that's going to reestablish energy in neurons, decrease inflammation, and increase oxygenation to hypoxic pockets. And I think from my perspective, giving something like a ketone ester with lower levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy would probably work. That's probably the, by far, the most controversial application, because there are some remarkable responses from people who have even a regeneration of brain cells after the hypoxic injury, for example, in kids who are very resilient anyway. I know Dr. Paul Harch has been know, has been on pretty much all the major news networks with the girl that sustained an incredibly severe hypoxic injury and brain death
Starting point is 00:44:12
and regenerated some of her brain, brain function and brain tissue. How old was the girl? She was pretty young, I think, five or six, I believe. And I met her, actually, one of the conferences. And it's very clear that nothing was working for her until she did hyperbaric auction therapy. But kids are completely, could be another story. We don't know if we could replicate that, but there are a lot of stories out there. Anacdotal reports, but it just has not been studied appropriately, and those studies need to be done. What do you see as the resistance? I mean, when you look at what's happened
Starting point is 00:44:48
in the last five years in the NFL, that has brought along with, I think, just the returning vets, TBI is, I mean, I don't think you could walk down Madison Avenue and hit someone with a rock who had at least heard the term TBI. So everybody knows what it is. We've got these two completely different demographics who are highly affected by it, athletes and soldiers.
Starting point is 00:45:13
What's the hang up? I mean, you and I have spent a lot of time behind the scenes trying to get organizations like the NC2A interested in studying this. I'm struggling to understand what the hangup is. You know, they're looking for devices to quantify TBI's and concussions, so that's a lot of funding is going into that area. At least when we talk about the NFL head challenge and something that we submitted to, you know, I don't really know.
Starting point is 00:45:43
I don't really know. I think the scientific rationale for a metabolic-based therapy for the brain makes a lot of sense in restoring oxygenation. I think the waters are very muddy though when it comes to hyperbaric oxygen with TBI. Because I mean, we even did some rat studies where repeated doses of hyperbaric oxygen in a concussion or a brain injury model, a rat, caused more injury can exacerbate the effects, whereas a single dose of hyperbaric oxygen right after at least an rat model
Starting point is 00:46:18
decreased the infarct size by maybe 30% something like that. So this is dangerous. I mean, we don't want someone listening to this who's suffered a TBI thinking, I'm gonna go to some off-label clinic and just max, repeatedly expose myself to hyperbarics. I mean, the point here is this has to be studied, it has to be studied rigorously,
Starting point is 00:46:37
it has to be studied empirically. And then we haven't even gotten to something we will get into later, which is the potential augmentation of the exogenous ketone. Yeah, yeah. I would not do hyperberegoxion therapy. If people are gonna do it within without, you know, what I say, I would definitely do hyperberegoxion therapy.
Starting point is 00:46:56
If you're gonna do it in strong nutritional ketosis, because a consequence of hyperberegoxion therapy is could be CNS-oxion toxicity. So you do not, the last thing you want if you have a brain injury is to have a seizure. And we know 85% of all penetrating traumatic brain injuries lead to seizures and people who've had penetrating.
Starting point is 00:47:19
What about blunt? I mean, it's less than that, but how much less? Yeah, so I don't know. I guess you would have to quantify the blunt. The severity. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But when it's less than that, but how much less? Yeah, so I don't know. I guess you would have to quantify the blood. The severity. Yeah, but when it comes to penetrating, but it's upwards about 85% of penetrating traumatic brain injuries have seizures.
Starting point is 00:47:33
And that's because you have excess glutamate, you know, and that's a very thing that's actually contributing to oxygen toxicity seizures. Right, so I think the biggest thing to do is to augment your brain energy metabolism to burn energy more efficiently. I think ketones do that and lower neuroinflammation. And I think there's a variety of ways to do that. But you don't want to throw more fuel on the fire. And I think high levels of hyperbaric oxygen therapy could be doing that. I think maybe
Starting point is 00:48:02
these soft chambers that go to like 1.4, 1.5, maybe a better means to implement that. Let's get into ketosis a little bit. I want to come back and talk about cancer. I want to come back and talk about the exogenous ketones, both the salts, the esters, and even different molecules. But one of the most interesting experiments we've seen in the physiology of ketones, as far as old school experiments, was the George K. Hill starvation experiments, right? I was highly motivated by that study.
Starting point is 00:48:31
We're going to link to it here, but why don't you give people the reader's digest version of what George K. Hill did that could probably never be done again? Yeah, yeah, and I was very lucky to connect with him. Before he died. He passed away in 2012 by connect with him a few years before that. And just to figure out, did he really do this? His studies. And there was a lot of studies that also didn't get published
Starting point is 00:48:53
that were pretty remarkable too, that somehow they got past ethics review at Harvard Medical School. But essentially what he did, a very elegant study to look at brain energy metabolism, the AV difference in blood and metabolites in subjects that fasted for 40 days. And most of the subjects were divinity students, I believe, or maybe conscience and subjectors to the war or something like that. But each person had a different story behind it. And he faceted these subjects for 40 days. And just to be clear, there's water and mineral only.
Starting point is 00:49:28
Water, no calories. Yeah, but they took mineral, right? They had magnesium and sodium. They did. I think they took a mineral supplement. And they also were, they weren't lean subjects, so they were subjects who, from their perspective, were overweight, if not obese subjects.
Starting point is 00:49:44
So they had some weight to lose. And it was very well documented and well controlled study where they monitored free fatty acids, insulin, glucose, beta hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone and... And let's all just pause you there for a moment for the listener. We'll come back to this because I want you to explain the difference between beta hydroxybutyrate or BHB, acetoacetate or ACAC and acetone, how they're produced, which ones are metabolically active, which ones aren't, but hopefully by me just saying this between the two of us, we'll remember to come back to that.
Starting point is 00:50:18
Yeah, so yeah, essentially three ketone bodies, beta hydroxybutyrate being the primary ketone that's elevated and more stable in the blood, and probably more likely to be a brain fuel. And if we just focus on that, ketone body, after seven days, it reached the level to where it was at or above the level of glucose in the subject. So glucose came down from five to six millim down to 3 and stayed at 3 milli molar throughout the duration of the experiment, throughout the duration of the fast from day 7, essentially to the remainder of the 40 days.
Starting point is 00:50:54
So for the Yankees listening to this, who aren't familiar with the metric system, 3 milli molar is about 55 milligrams per desolate. Yeah, yep. Okay, so that's pretty darn low. Yeah. But what's interesting is it gets down there, I think it was between day seven and day 10, it hit three millimolar,
Starting point is 00:51:12
and then it just never went down again. Yeah, yeah. Which is what the heck is going on? These people don't eat any glucose. How do they sell? And what that tells you by definition is their liver still had glycogen because that you have to be putting that glucose
Starting point is 00:51:25
out from the liver. Yep. The maintenance of glucose is under very powerful, homeostatic mechanisms. We're hardwired from an evolutionary perspective to maintain glucose. The glucose can be coming from gluconeogenic amino acids, so we are breaking down some muscle. And then the glycerol backbone of triglycerides, too, also contributes to the production of- So triglycerides being the storage form of fatty acids, you have a three carbon backbone, that's called a glycerol backbone. It has three of these free fatty acids that are, well, they become free once they're cleaved, they become the substrate
Starting point is 00:52:05
that you're going to explain to us in a few minutes is how you make BHB or beta hydroxybutyrate. But you don't just throw that glycerol out, you can actually, the liver can turn that back into glycogen within itself to then slowly trickle out into the bloodstream. Exactly. So when K-Hill did this, if I recall insulin levels also got very low. By day seven, the insulin levels were at rock bottom and sort of stayed there. Yeah, they're real. One of the interesting things about the experiment, in addition to the stuff I want to hear about, which is the brain metabolism, and how did the brain partition those fuels, is was this experiment to a different one where he was able to give insulin lower glucose levels,
Starting point is 00:52:45
but not generate CNS trauma through that. Yeah, so the subjects were asymptomatic for hypoglycemia and they felt really fine. And in another level, like one minimal. Yeah, so they infused, I be infusion of 20 I use of insulin and pushed glucose from three millimolar or their bouts down to roughly one millimolar, which is like less than 20 milligrams per desolate, which would be fatal. That would be a universal fatal level of glucose. Even two, two becomes like coma and essentially fatal if it's maintained. I hit two very briefly during an insulin suppression test I had at Stanford and I was no longer
Starting point is 00:53:28
in ketosis because I was doing this in the most present test. So I started at about two and a half or three millimolar, but 90 minutes later my ketones had withered down to like point three point four. And then my glucose hit about 38 milligrams per desolate and I really, that was the day I thought I was gone. That's the desicc dangerous area. Oh yeah, no, I thought I was gone. I have a little self-experiment. I can mention after this, but essentially what they did,
Starting point is 00:53:55
which was a very bold and gutsy demonstration. They injected insulin, which facilitated glucose disposal in the patients, essentially, and brought blood glucose down to roughly one millimolar, which is universally fatal, and the subjects were relatively asymptomatic for hypoglycemia, which was remarkable. Their ketones were maintained at about above five to six millimolar. That is out-fre out freaking rages. Like when you just stop to think about how you could take a normal healthy volunteer
Starting point is 00:54:33
and do something, I mean, we're all in the spirit of learning, but when you just think about that from an ethical standpoint, like how close. I can't do that in mice. I'm not allowed to do that in mice. The IACook, the Institute for Animal Care and Humanity, you know, would not approve fasting for more than 20. I think it's for 24 at our institution.
Starting point is 00:54:51
Yeah, so that's from mice, and maybe rats might be 48. But yeah, and the use of insulin to further, I'm my serve on the IACook. I mean, these things would be quickly rejected. I mean, this is the Wild Wild West. Yeah, and then just the last thing on this topic that I remember, which I'd love you to expand on, is what did we learn about how the brain partitioned fuel?
Starting point is 00:55:13
How much of the brain's energy? Once you were in that steady state after about 10 days came from glucose, beta hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate. Yeah, so beta hydroxybutyrate accounted for approximately 60% of the energy and probably 10% acetoacetate. And roughly at that point, after about 10 days, only about a third of the energy was coming from glucose, right?
Starting point is 00:55:40
And basically what's in your blood as far as ketones and glucose is what your brain is utilizing. You know, your brain's in a hungry state and it's effectively utilizing and clearing those metabolites. You can do that. It was very elegant demonstration and it kind of changed our understanding of brain energy metabolism as glucose being exclusive predominant fuel. So in a fed state, they were consuming 100% of their brain energy metabolism was from glucose. But only after being fasted, did that change? And he went on to write a number of reviews
Starting point is 00:56:14
and went on with Dr. Veach, who actually created and developed some of the, they published together. The key to that. Veach was a postdoc with Kale, wasn't he? A postdoc. Yeah, he was a student of Hans Kreb actually and then he was one of the K-Hill. I forgot that fact. Yeah, he was one of his best students from my understanding, yeah, from word of mouth. Yeah, they went and they worked together in different capacities. Yeah, I think you might have been a fellow with him. I think most people listening to this,
Starting point is 00:56:40
if they can dig back to high school biology, that name CREBs will sort of ring a bell, right? Yeah, yeah. So, you mentioned that K-Hill shared with you stuff that wasn't even published. Do you remember anything that struck you as super interesting that was unpublished? Yeah, you know, some things maybe... Not worth talking about. Well, yeah, I don't know if he...
Starting point is 00:57:01
I do have some stories and then I heard some stories through other people too. Well, I don't wanna make you say anything that you're not comfortable saying publicly. But I would say some of the work that was done in animals definitely suggested that glucose could go lower, even lower, and that you could really transition your metabolic physiology to be fueled off fats and ketones and that that was against what we knew. These were remarkable observations that changed the whole
Starting point is 00:57:34
context of what we knew about metabolic physiology and brain energy metabolism. Do we know today if the brain can use lactate directly as a fuel without it having to go through the Choricycle? Yeah, most certainly can. I think lactates are actually a great fuel. And that's one of the first fuels I got interested in when I was studying hypoxia, and then later even hypoxia was thinking about using lactate,
Starting point is 00:57:58
different forms of orally available lactate, like polio lactate. I think it's in the product Cytomax if you remember for cycling. Are you still using Cytomax? Yeah. So, I was actually interested in that and that actually led me to ketones and then once I got more into studying ketones and discovered somehow it slipped past me all the years I thought
Starting point is 00:58:18
I knew what a ketogenic diet was but then when I read about the history of the ketogenic diet being used for almost a century and I realized that it was like the standard of care for seizures and then understanding that these ketones can largely replace glucose as the energy source and then they have these signaling properties that are even independent of metabolism that are remarkable. Over the last five years a lot of these big labs are looking at the epigenetic effects of ketones, functioning as Class 1, Class 2 histone-dyssalase. The functioning as a suppressor of the NLRP3 in flamazone, producing less inflammation in a metabolic independent way.
Starting point is 00:59:01
So you obviously pretty quickly come to this idea that these ketones are interesting molecules and they're interesting for a couple of reasons at the very least what you just said, which is they have signaling properties that make them kind of unique. Outside of the exogenous ketones though, you have to also undergo a pretty extreme physiologic change, at least in a Western culture, to make enough of these to matter, and you have to restrict carbohydrates and protein to get there. So, did you first personally get interested in this from a nutritional standpoint, and
Starting point is 00:59:33
then eventually through this exogenous pathway or vice versa? Yeah, so ketone esters to my knowledge in 2008 didn't exist. They actually did, but I didn't know of them. I discovered them on a DARPA website as some work that was being funded, you know, and developing of the ketone esters for warfighter performance. But at the time when I just decided to go down the route of the ketogenic diet, I reached out to John's Hopkins and the crew there. Which is where the anti-seizure therapy was pioneered, right? Yeah, Mayo Clinic first and then they worked together with Hopkins.
Starting point is 01:00:09
I would say the bulk of the work that was done to develop the protocols for the QJank Diet, which are in use today, was developed at Johns Hopkins. And I got Eric Kossoff books, his book with a published with John Freeman, which was I just went out and did the classical ketogenic diet, the 4 to 1 ratio. So four parts fat and one part being protein and carbohydrates. It equates out to 87 to upwards of 90 percent fat, maybe 10 percent protein, and like one or two percent carbohydrates. So I mean, it's like basically eating super low carb and then adding mountains of fat on top of that plate, making like a super low carb meal
Starting point is 01:00:51
with protein restrict and then add some butter and a couple cups of heavy cream with that. And that's, I started weighing everything out. And what year did you start that? 2008, I think in nine, I think it was 2008 or nine that Eric Kassoff published the Modify Acutage Antiet, which was more liberal in protein and increasing protein from 10% to 25% and 30% or 25% is a huge difference. Like you can, that's actually a diet that I mostly adhere to now. And I followed the ketogenic diet, and I bought the strips were very expensive at the time. There was a couple different kits
Starting point is 01:01:30
that I got to measure my own ketones, and I immersed myself in it, I got obsessed with it, and I wanted to know what it felt like to have a brain that ran on ketones. And how high did your levels get measured in the blood? I kind of struggled to get up there, even with the classical ketogenic diets, two and 2.5, I would typically with the classical,
Starting point is 01:01:51
and this is before MCTs. So I wasn't quite using MCTs yet in 2009. I started to incorporate the same time I discovered the modified ketogenic diet was the same time I started using MCTs and a modified ketogenic diet with MCTs got my ketone levels up probably higher than the classical ketogenic diet, which was just mostly a dairy-based long-chain fat derived diet. Let's tell everybody how we make ketones and then we'll tell them what an MCT is for them
Starting point is 01:02:23
to don't know. Let's talk about starvation ketosis. And then if there's differences between that that are worth highlighting with nutritional, that would be great. But evolutionarily, I'm going to deprive you from eating for a few days. How do you survive? Well, you start burning up your liver glycogen. Okay.
Starting point is 01:02:40
So it was 24 hours later, you've got that down to about half of its half to let a quarter of its supply. Mm-hmm. Through the suppression of the hormone insulin, we start mobilizing fat from adipose tissue, which are cells, pretty much all cells in the body, especially muscle and heart cells, burned fat, like a superior energy source. Long-chain fatty acids don't effectively cross the blood brain barrier, so through accelerated fat oxidation, beta oxidation, and fats in the liver, that stimulates the accumulation of acetyl-CoA, which forms acetyl-acetyl and ultimately beta hydroxybutyrate, so you start spilling these ketone bodies through accelerated fat oxidation in the liver. The liver lacks succinyl coatransferase, so it does not actually use the ketone bodies
Starting point is 01:03:29
for fuel, and they become available for your brain, essential nervous system and peripheral tissues. So the liver is secreting beta hydroxybutyrate, and- And it's going to acetate to some extent. Okay, so is the BHB being made and then being converted into acetoacetator is the liver making both. Acetoacetate first and then beta hydroxybutyrate. And it's interesting that some people have a ratio of beta hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate of 2 to 1 and some people 5 to 1, generally speaking about 4 to 1. So acetoacetate is unstable in that it can spontaneously decarboxylate to acetone, which is volatile, and we blow it off in our breath.
Starting point is 01:04:10
Does it have metabolic activity? Can we... It was thought that it didn't, but more recent work is suggesting that the carbons of acetone do find their way into sort of lipid biosynthesis and some other things, but it's kind of rare for that. But it's not a great ATP source. Not, no, not really. It has some effect on neurons, so it has an anti-convulsive effect through, I believe,
Starting point is 01:04:36
opening a potassium channel, which could hyperpolarize the membrane potential and actually help attenuate some hyperexcite ability in the brain. So there are people that study, you know, the effects of acetone as a subnarcotic levels of acetone, right? Acetone can be pretty narcotic and be problematic, but acetone levels that are 0.5 millimolar and even upwards of 1 millimolar can have a neuro protective effect. Once you get above 1 millimolar, you start to dissolve some of the membranes and you can have sort of... It doesn't sound.
Starting point is 01:05:12
Yeah, you have problematic. You know, acetone is a pretty powerful solvent, right? It's a nail polish remover. But small levels of acetone and neuroprotective, and that's actually something that we study. So how do aceto acetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate enter the crebs cycle? In other words, where do we get ATP from them? It depends on the cells. So different cells have different, we're looking at this now, different ketolytic enzymes,
Starting point is 01:05:36
right? So they can feed in through a number of different pathways, like I said, the liver is the production site of beta-hyd hydroxybutyrate. When it comes to skeletal muscle, they have a range of ketolate againsimes that can allow them to enter the crebs cycle at different areas. So, succinate, for example. So you can replenish TCA cycle intermediates with succinate, you can acetyl acetate, can break down and provide acetyl CoA Before the crebs like so what we're finding is that the crebs cycle is not the simple cycle that we thought it was
Starting point is 01:06:15
especially as it relates to cancer cells So it's almost like we can't even look at the biochemistry book and kind of pinpoint different pathways. With substrate level phosphorylation, there are a number of different pathways like the malade, aspartate shuttle that are associated with cancer cells if we go back to those pathways. Did you see that paper that came out in nature two days ago about aspartate being a right limiting step in cancer metabolism in the mitochondria? I didn't see that paper that came out in nature two days ago about Asperate being a rate limiting step in cancer metabolism in the mitochondria? I didn't see that.
Starting point is 01:06:48
Bob and I were just talking about it today. It's interesting because the paper was part of it was written through a lens of, hey, this might be how Metformin can exert some of its anti-cancer benefits by interfering with Asperate. I think it was interfering with degradation of Asperate. But again, I haven't read the paper yet, just sort of the abstract, but was yet another like, I didn't know that, wow. Every day, I feel like I'm getting dumber
Starting point is 01:07:13
because the rate at which I'm being exposed to new information is exceeding the rate at which I'm assimilating it, so it feels like I'm on a downward spiral to stupidity. There are textbook pathways that I used to just rattle off and it all seems so simple. And then, you know, I read three or four papers and I realized that I probably shouldn't talk about it in some simplistic terms like that. And we're kind of going down the rabbit hole of glutamine elicis, right?
Starting point is 01:07:41
So glutamine is the fermentable fuel. So ketones are a non-fermentable fuel, whereas cancer cells were used glucose and glutamine as the two primary fermentable fuels. It's funny, I mean I know that biochemically. I'd never thought of it in those terms though. Yeah, yeah, it's not fermentable. That's interesting. So that's kind of what I'm thinking about, you know, in terms of ketone metabolism with glutamate. Or glutamine, glutamine can make glutamate, and alanine, and aspartate, and lactate, and glutamine lysis is driven by the malay aspartate shuttle.
Starting point is 01:08:20
That has become a major focus now of many cancer researchers are looking to target glutamine and it's not easy. I mean, because you have, if you have a glutaminated inhibitor, that has tremendous side effects. Huge toxicity. Right, yeah. So we need to approach this in a very nuanced sort of way when it comes to targeting glutamine. Yeah. So let's go back to the MCT.
Starting point is 01:08:42
So you talked about how you started out on a 4-to-1 ratio, which is interesting. I started out 4 to 1. I spent three years on just 4 to 1. I never deviated from 4 to 1. But then you mentioned you went to 2 to 1, which is obviously much easier to do, but you augmented with MCT. So MCT of course stands for medium change like glyceride. There are a type of saturated fat and there of a certain length. And I don't even remember anymore. Is it 8 to 14 carbons? Is what we define as MCT? Yeah, 8 to 10, I think 8 to 14 from in that.
Starting point is 01:09:12
But when we talk about the ketogenic ones, the they're more, they're closer to caprylic acid, which is the C8s. So why does, why does taking those make this process easier? When you consume them orally, they are transported to the liver via hepatic portal circulation and they're not packaged into chylamicrons. And you know, long chain fatty acids, when we eat them, they are packaged into chylamicrons and then they go through essentially enter the lymphatic system and have a different route of entry.
Starting point is 01:09:42
They're metabolized totally differently. Whereas medium chain fats go directly to the liver through a paddock portal circulation. And it's like a bolus of fat going to the liver. And it's a type of fat that's rapidly oxidized. The liver is chock full of mitochondria. So if I want to study mitochondria, I'll take out a chunk of the liver
Starting point is 01:10:01
and isolate it from that, because that's the easiest thing to do. So the mitochondria really burn up medium-chain triglycerides very quickly and there's very high rates of fat oxidation the liver from an oral bolus of medium-chain triglycerides. So they're much less likely to be stored as fat, they're a source of calories, and they can be incorporated into meals and into foods to further enhance and boost the ketone levels of the ketogenic diet or even if you're not on a ketogenic diet, they can be consumed with a high carbohydrate diet and actually elevate ketones in the blood. Yeah, I mean, I've heard that, but I've never actually measured it probably because I've only done this with liquid MCT, which you end up getting to sort of GI tolerance,
Starting point is 01:10:45
becomes an issue probably before you get a high enough level. But if you're on a high carb diet, and you consume, I don't know, two to three table spoons of MCT, how high could you reasonably expect your BHB to get? Depending on your absorption anywhere between 0.5 to 1 milli molar. That's high. I would say, yeah, even on a high. yeah, if it's pure C8, maybe,
Starting point is 01:11:08
so with C8, you get about a 20, maybe 30% elevation above like a mix of the C10 C8, which is generic. There's some work being done that C10 may actually have some beneficial effects. I mean, that's kind of the idea behind the product, exonah, that was on the market, you know, a while back. I don't know if it's still on the market. I don, that's kind of the idea behind the product exonah that was on the market, you know, a while back. I don't know if it's still in the market. I don't know what it is. Yeah, it's a basically C8. It's powdered C8. Oh, I was just. It's just a word of pure C8. Yeah, you can. I wrote it like from
Starting point is 01:11:35
sigma or something like that. Yeah. Well, Dave Astrid's brain octane is is capryliciglyceride. And Perillo Nutrition makes Captree, which is a C8 oil. So if you buy pure C8, not in triglyceride form, Caprilic, if you just... Just straight. Frilic acid, that'll kill you. I mean, you consume that. I made the mistake early on and bought from Sigma, Caprilic acid, but not, you need to buy...
Starting point is 01:12:03
How did you lose triglyceride? How did you catch that mistake before ingesting it? I bought it from sigma, caprylic acid, but not, you need to buy a caprylic tricolour. You've got to catch that mistake before ingesting it. I bought it from sigma and I think I was going to use it in experiments and we were going to mix it with our rat chow and I wanted to go through a legitimate source. And I put a little bit on my finger and it burnt my tongue off and I realized, wait a second, I think I need
Starting point is 01:12:24
to triglyceride form of caprylic acid, I think I need to triglyceride form of caprylic acid. I need to caprylic triglyceride. Yeah, I almost killed myself. You almost won a Darwin award. Don't, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know, I never looked at you.
Starting point is 01:12:34
Leading if any tone recently probably did that before. Accidentally kills himself. Yeah. Have you had any experience with the powdered MCTs? Yeah, yeah. So powdered MCTs allow me to increase my ketone levels higher than I use the quest powdered MCT formula. There's a couple on the market now, maybe yeah I have that of this stuff at home because I feel like anyone who's ever made a ketone product
Starting point is 01:12:59
Just somehow make figures out my address and sends them to me So I have a pantry full of every type of ketone you can imagine. I do too. But I haven't, yeah, you probably get more than me. I just haven't got around to trying any of the MCT powder, but I'm getting ready to do a long fast in a couple of weeks. And I was thinking I really ought to make sure I'm back in ketosis the week before I deprived myself
Starting point is 01:13:22
of food for a week. So I was actually just thinking about this last week, which is I got to fire up those patterned MCT and kickstart this thing because I don't have like a couple months to get fully adapted. Yeah. They are great. I mean, MCTs are kind of like the poor man's ketone ester, right? So they are, they're, they're found in nature, they're versatile.
Starting point is 01:13:41
You can incorporate them in the tube. I wouldn't even call them the middle classes man. Yeah, the middle class. The key tone ester. Given how expensive ketone ester is, aren't incorporate them in the studio. I would even call them the middle classes, man. Yeah, the middle classes. Given how expensive ketone asser is, aren't that? That's right, that's right. So I tinkered a lot with MCTs early on and increased my tolerability from maybe 30 milliliters a day to 150 milliliters a day.
Starting point is 01:13:58
Well, we're really easily. Hang on a second, that's ridiculous. Yeah. Anytime I went to 30 in one sitting, 10 tables, been full. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Yeah, anytime I went to 30 in one sitting. Yeah, ten tables been full. Yeah, that's it there, right? Yeah, that's hard to fathom. You need to incorporate it with food.
Starting point is 01:14:12
So I was spreading it. What I found I needed to do was instead of doing intermittent fasting now, which I pretty much do now, I spread it out over like four meals and maybe would have a little bit of MCT in the coffee too and not including that in a meal. So I was eating a modified ketogenic diet but spreading that MCT out with salad dressings, putting it on vegetables and things like that and I was able to.
Starting point is 01:14:37
Because if anybody's listening to this and is trying to, like they're just sitting there thinking, what could I do to do to have a bowel prep? Like the answer is just drink MCT. It's better than Fleet's phosphosoda. You will spend the day in the bathroom and you'll have a great cold bath. But you can work your way up to it. There's a number of transporters, obviously, that are upregulated and you are enhancing
Starting point is 01:15:01
the breakdown and transport of these. MCTs actually do cross the blood brain barrier. So we did studies in rats where we take out the... But they're getting absorbed portally. How do we know? Oh, okay. Some of them, I forget the percentage, but I think, and some people say it's like 50% of MCTs converted to ketones, but I think it's something like about 20% of MCTs.
Starting point is 01:15:23
And it depends on the energetic state of the liver, which is the master regulator and your physiology in general. But you have a fairly significant portion of the MCTs being converted to ketones. But the MCTs do enter the blood and they can cross the blood brain barrier unlike the long-chain fats. And they, for example, if you take out the hippocampi of rats that are eating
Starting point is 01:15:46
an MCT-based ketogenic diet, you'll find MCT levels are significantly elevated. So they're crossing, they're getting into the brain and the brain is utilizing MCTs as fuel. And do we know if that has any anti-seizure effect independent of the ketone that might be produced alongside it? That's a big area of research right now that MCTs is functional fats. So, and... I've never heard that term before, functional fats. Yeah, like, well, fats with drug-like properties.
Starting point is 01:16:12
So I think there's a number of patents around C10, actually, that I know they have in the UK. I think it might be a pharmaceutical now. So C10 actually has anti-seager properties. So there's some people argue that the effects of the ketogenic diet, at least with MCTs, is not due to ketones, but actually due to the MCTs and not the ketones. So there's a couple of groups out there that are sort of arguing that. And I think they have a case, but I think it's probably a comment, definitely a combination of the ketones and the MCTs.
Starting point is 01:16:47
So MCTs do have interesting property. Do you know Elizabeth Teal at Boston Children's? So I remember having breakfast with her about six years ago and asking her a question that at the time, I don't think she knew the answer, too. And she was gracious enough to explain that. And she was there with someone else in her lab, so it was a very spirited, awesome discussion. But I wonder if the answer is known today. The question was basically, do you believe that the anti-seizure properties of a ketogenic
Starting point is 01:17:15
diet are more the result of the brain having another fuel to displace glucose or due to the reduction in glucose that invariably accompanies ketogenesis. And at the time, she shared with me very compelling data that could argue either of those points, potentially suggesting it was the combination of them. Do you have a point of view on this or is there more information today that steers you one way or the other? Well, I know she's done some work with the low glycemic index diet. So carbohydrate reduction but without the production of ketones? Yeah, so a reduction, it's carbohydrate restriction,
Starting point is 01:17:55
but only to the effect of maybe 20 or 25 percent, you know, low. And then carbohydrates that are low glycemic index. And what are the results of that intervention? For different types of seizures, it can have a positive effect and for certain types of seizures. That's not the first line of therapy for very powerful tonic-lonic seizures in pediatric. You want to go right to the classical ketogenic diet, but it does have a number of applications
Starting point is 01:18:22
for different types of seizure disorders. And what about if you take someone on a fully-carb diet does have a number of applications for different types of seizure disorders. What about if you take someone on a fully carb diet who's having recalcitrant seizures and you give them exogenous ketone? Does that have anti-seizure benefit? Yeah, so those studies have not been done yet. There is a study being recruiting right now for somebody called Angelman Syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that has seizures
Starting point is 01:18:47
where the exogenous ketones are the therapy independent of the diet. So they're just being added on top of the diet. There are people out there because exogenous ketones are commercially available that are using this in place of the ketogenic diet because the families are either unwilling or for various reasons unable to use the ketogenic diet and they use, are using exogenous ketones
Starting point is 01:19:13
and the feedback that I'm getting could be biased but it does seem to have an effect. It obviously has an effect in animal models. The animal models that we work with, we give exogenous ketones on top of a standard rat chow, which is high carbohydrate chow. And it works very well for CNS oxygen toxicity, but also for things like phenylintetrizol seizures, PZT seizures, even for abs and seizures. We use a particular animal model with abs and seizures,
Starting point is 01:19:42
and that wraps on seizures, which works for that. So it works for a variety of different seizure models. Independent, we are circumventing sort of the dietary restriction that's typically associated with getting into therapeutic ketosis and just simply giving exogenous ketones and elevating exogenous ketones. But a consideration is that exogenous ketones lower blood glucose.
Starting point is 01:20:06
So you have, and in some cases it lowers it really low, like the high dose ketones that we do in our rat models. It pushes, and rats typically maintain a glucose of around 140 to 150, and it'll push it down to 40. So milligrams per deciliter, yeah. And that's approaching the maximum tolerable dose of the ketone ester. And it's interesting when we go above the maximum tolerable dose, we actually see glucose levels spike up.
Starting point is 01:20:33
And this is a phenomenon that we see. It's almost like it's stressing out the liver, just regulating the liver in some way. It's the data we're trying to figure out. But if you titrate in ketone salts or ketone salt, MCT combination or various ketone esters, it's inversely proportional to as you elevate ketones, you have a very predictable, reliable decrease in blood glucose. That's above and beyond the decrease in blood glucose that you'd observe with something like metformin. And we use metformin for many, many studies in a lab. And we have a lot of experience with that.
Starting point is 01:21:09
So what do we think, you know, it's funny, I was up in San Francisco like a month ago, and I was talking with Steve Finney, who, you know, at the outset, I said, you're one of the people who I would say knows more about ketosis than anyone alive. And certainly Steve would have to be in that category. So I would, if I were going to just guess, I would say, between you and Steve Finney, if the were gonna just guess, I would say, between you and Steve Finney, if the answer isn't really known on ketosis,
Starting point is 01:21:29
the answer might not be known. Yeah. So, but, and Steve and I were having this really fun discussion with a few other folks about, why is it that the ketones are driving down the glucose levels? And conversely, and maybe this is a different question, of course, but why is it that when
Starting point is 01:21:46
we do these experiments of you take somebody in nutritional ketosis and you make them do really, really aggressive exercise, you know, do a two minute all out effort on the rowing machine that the ketones go way down and the glucose goes way up. Is it solely a consumption and hepatic glucose output issue? Is there something else going on? And I was like, well, I kind of always assumed that we knew the answer to that and that it was the explanation I had. But at the end of that discussion, I was like, actually, I pretty much now don't think I know the answer to this question.
Starting point is 01:22:18
I don't think we do. I have three potential explanations. One could be an exogenous ketone induced release in insulin that facilitates glucose disposal. So that happens. You do get, I mean, it's not like consuming a protein bulls or a carbohydrate bulls, but you do get an elevation of ketones. That's how we moderate our ketone levels, right? So as our ketone levels, if we're on the ketogenic diet and our ketones become elevated, there's ketone urea, we pee out some ketones and there's a number of probably,
Starting point is 01:22:51
but one is a ketone induced release of insulin which then feeds back on the liver to like a reosti, really, and lowering beta oxidation. Which totally makes sense, because that's the reason that someone with tight one diabetes can get keto acid doses They lose the checkpoint. Yep. Yep, and other researchers like if you ask Richard Vich
Starting point is 01:23:10
He'll tell you that insulin sensitivity is increased so the insulin that you have available and Associated signaling is being enhanced in the presence of ketones So is that an immediate change or is that a change that takes place over a long period of time? That sounds like a longstanding issue. I think there's a number of regulatory things that happen. I know in his study where rats were fed standard rodent chow, but 30 to 20% ketone ester, I think, within that chow, their baseline insulin levels went down like 50%. So that's just simply by, you know,
Starting point is 01:23:47
just the addition of the ketone lower. Yeah, just the addition of the ketone over time. Over, I think it was like maybe a three week. I got to look at the see the study. But it was, it was consuming ketone ester that was integrated into the rat chow over a number of weeks, decreased baseline levels of insulin significantly.
Starting point is 01:24:06
I mean, it was like a huge effect. And the implications of that, you know, is a rat study, you know, you can argue rat study, but I can tell you experimentally that, or just, you know, testing on myself, that the same observation happens. I can actually, if I get a significant amount of my calories from exogenous ketones, and I do that over several weeks, and I measure my insulin, it gets below the reference range. Whereas if I get back to a regular ketogenic diet, I'm always on the low end of the reference range.
Starting point is 01:24:37
But I did find if I consume the maximum tolerable dose of a ketone ester or a ketone salt, and then I measure insulin, you know, an hour or two after that I do get a little bump up in insulin, but it's nowhere near the bump I would get up if I ate an equivalent amount of calories from protein or carbohydrates which would shoot me up to like, you know, eight or ten or something like that, you know, with a big dose But it's usually somewhere around I bump it up from like 1.5 to like 2.5 or 3 or something like that. That's super low. That's my baseline and it's usually between 1 and 2.
Starting point is 01:25:09
So is your IGF level changed in the years that you've been on ketosis? Have you tracked it much? I have not. I've gotten it measured a few times, but not reliably. Like I do insulin quite often, like every two months or so. Like I'm doing that. And if I'm doing an experiment, I may do multiple measurements of insulin like throughout the week,
Starting point is 01:25:29
but I haven't measured IGF1 recently. I did it a while back and I was just in the normal range. But I wasn't fasting. I didn't, that's the one variable. I wish I would have tried insulin was low, so I can assume IGF1 might have been a little bit low. Yeah. So just for listeners and stuff, how do we measure ketones?
Starting point is 01:25:45
I mean, people talk about urine strips versus blood. What are you measuring in each and breath for that matter? You've got three ways to theoretically measure these things. Which one do we prefer and why? For a newbie getting into this, I think the urine ketone strips will at least tell you if you're in ketosis or not in ketosis. What is it measuring? A urine strip?
Starting point is 01:26:03
It's measuring on it and what does it tell you? Urine acetoacetate is measured. And now there's a urine beta hydroxybutyrate ketosis or non-inketosis? What is it measuring? It's measuring. It's being on it and what does it tell you? Urin acetoacetate is measured. And now there's a urine beta hydroxybutyrate kits that are available, so you could do that. So the Abbott Labs precision extra and the keto mojo are two devices that will measure basically an assay, a home assay kit for beta hydroxybutyrate. We have used both of those things and measured it against various assays in the lab and blood that we send out for analysis.
Starting point is 01:26:34
It's pretty close. Pretty close plus or minus maybe 10 or 15%. What does the urinary level, even though it's a qualitative assay, but you know, everybody says, hey, my urinary ketone thing lit up right purple, can we infer anything from that about the blood level of BHB or acetoacetate? Usually, you know, unless you're running kind of dehydrated, you know, if you have a normal hydration state and your urine acetoacetate is 40 milligrams per decilator or above. You are probably hitting one milli molar or above. If you're anywhere between 40 and 80 to, I think, 160 milligrams per decilator,
Starting point is 01:27:14
so you're in a state of ketosis. If you're at 15, that's like light pink or something, you're usually probably not in a state what I would say a ketosis. That might be a normal state if you wake up in the morning in sort of a fasted state, you might be hitting that. But generally speaking, you need to be at about 80 milligrams per desolate
Starting point is 01:27:33
on the urine ketone strip. And the one thing I didn't do, rather, when I was doing my sort of long foray into ketosis is I didn't use the urine meters at all. I was just, you know, I was, I was keeping Abbott in business, basically, with how many of those precision extrude strips I was going through.
Starting point is 01:27:50
So I don't know if my urinary excretion actually declined over time when my body became better and better at retaining this potentially preferred fuel. Have you done anything on that either personally or in the lab? So what we use in the lab is the Clinitex status device. And that device takes the Siemens 10SG kit, so the multi-stick.
Starting point is 01:28:14
So you can buy for a similar cost as the keto stick. You could buy the Siemens 10SG multi-stick. And that measures 10 things, including urine acetoacetate. And you could take that urine strip and stick that in a device that will give you more of a quantified number. I see. So that's how you were giving me quantitative information on the urine because I've only seen
Starting point is 01:28:38
the qualitative stuff. Well, it's a color change on the strip that's measured in the device. Right, but in the device. The device tells you now. Over the years, I rejected urine ketone strips as something that just wasn't very accurate. The more I use them, making hundreds, if not thousands of measurements, the more I gain an appreciation that it can be a pretty useful device.
Starting point is 01:29:01
I think it's useful for the individual. Your hydration status definitely changes it. I mean, I've been in situations where I'm dehydrated, where I've come out of the water after like a six-hour dive and I've peed on those things and it's like, it's like screaming. And I knew, I mean, I did some dives where I purposely wasn't in ketosis for some of the research that we do. And I was deep into ketosis just because I was very dehydrated. I didn't know someone could die for six hours. I was on the NASA Nemo Extreme Environment Mission Operations trip. So I was a crew member on that where I maintained,
Starting point is 01:29:37
I was lived in saturation for 10 days in a hyperbaric environment. And that involves like an 18, 19 hour decompression to come out. So it's a NASA sort of a Mars analog mission where you work with astronauts underneath the sea. And I maintained a state of ketosis throughout that whole mission and did lots and lots of measurements on myself down there. And I saw really, when at one time I got out after maybe it was a six-hour EVA. So essentially, you're in a hyperbarek habitat on the bottom of the ocean and then you go
Starting point is 01:30:11
out into the water and then you come back inside the hyperbarek habitat. But when you're out in the water, even though you're down in the keys, the water pulls heat from you like 200 times faster than air. So even though it's like, you know, upper 80s, I come out of that hypothermic and dehydrated. My blood glucose always was in like the 30s, sometimes in the 40s, when I was on the ket, I was testing something ketone supplements. Wow.
Starting point is 01:30:39
What were the other people experiencing under those circumstances? Well, we'll find out with this, my wife actually was selected as a crew member for NASA Nemo 23. I was on 22. And I did not get the IRB protocol approved to do all the metabolic studies that I wanted to do, but I became an end of one on that. And I collected a lot of data on myself. So with this new mission, we have the Nemo Nassonimo 23, we'll be able to make some pretty
Starting point is 01:31:11
comprehensive metabolic measurements, including things like hemoglobin H1C, we're going to measure inflammation, HSCRP, glucose ketones, all these things on all the crew members. Interestingly this year, it's an all-female crew. So you have like Samantha Christopher Eddie, the famous European Tracy Caldwell Dyson, who I've known at NASA and my wife, and it's all female. So we'll have some female data to go along with this. What surprised you the most in your end of one?
Starting point is 01:31:41
What did you see that you least expected? I saw why predicted that the habitat would really trigger inflammation that was probably from the elevated CO2 levels and the elevated oxidative stress. I chose to stay in a state of ketosis with the idea that that was my baseline state. We're doing studies on sleep. We're using the ore ring. You're doing studies on sleep. We're using the ORA ring. You're probably familiar with that on sleep, and also the Polar V800 to collect heart rate variability data, gut microbiome.
Starting point is 01:32:13
We're doing body composition measurements. We're doing stress. So we use the NIH toolbox and joggle to look at cognitive psych parameters. So that data has not been shared to me, so I don't know my wife collected some of that data, and that's being analyzed later on for publication. But from a metabolic perspective,
Starting point is 01:32:35
from a hormone perspective, some of the things living in that environment for 10 days, decrease my testosterone. At a 25% decrease in testosterone from the time. So we're fairly, maybe fairly sleep deprived. I average about six hours of sleep per night, but I was getting like two and a half hours of deep sleep, which is more deep sleep than a typical, yeah, I was like, I don't know if it's something in the entire...
Starting point is 01:33:00
It might be an artifact of how the sleep is being estimated. In other words, you know, assuming you're giving that off the aura ring, right? Yeah, that was a aura ring. So the aura ring is measuring. But I usually get about 90 minutes, sometimes like last night, I got one hour and 53 minutes of deep sleep, but I usually get about one hour, one and a half hours of deep sleep.
Starting point is 01:33:19
But I got over two hours every night, and instead of seven hours sleep a night, I was getting consistently just, you know, five to six hours sleep and night. So where are you getting mostly short changed on REM? Yeah on REM. But my REM was even not that bad. You show I was getting about an hour you know an hour REM which is not as much as that's right. That's too low. Usually it too is optimal for me I think. So yeah we measured sleep. The things that really stood out were being in the water really pushes my body into and being hypothermic really turns me into a fat burning machine. My ketones go off the chart and my glucose goes way down. It almost
Starting point is 01:33:57
looks like a six hour EVA when I came back into the habitat looked like I fasted for a week. So I have all that data for that too, that I need to compile. And now I... Should we be looking at that, we meaning people as a potential way to replicate fast under a more stressful state? Looking at what, just underwater.
Starting point is 01:34:17
Yeah, do you think it was a combination of temperature and pressure primarily that was driving that effect? So over the holidays, we went to Thailand, and I did a lot of nitroxdives, something like 30 nitroxdives, and I made these measurements too, and I did see trends for decreased glucose.
Starting point is 01:34:36
And nitroxdives were doing like an hour, maybe an hour and a half dives at the most. And I saw trends, but nothing like the trends I saw in the saturation environment when we did these long EVAs. So do you think that the temperature was different from the duration? The temperature really has to have a difference because you come out and you're kind of shaky. You know, even though you feel very comfy when you're down there, the first two or three hours, and then by the end, the last four, five, six hours
Starting point is 01:35:05
for a longer EVA, you start shaking a little bit uncontrollably. But it's kind of subtle, even though the water's kind of warm, like it feels warm, but your body temperature is going down. And they were on the days, maybe I wasn't getting as much calories as I needed. I came out of that mission later than I've ever been before. I came out, when we got back to mainland and I stepped on the scale, I was 207, which is super low for me. I ended up losing about. Maybe
Starting point is 01:35:34
I went in kind of late because I was training for it. I'm not a very good swimmer like you. I had the really trained to meet, like you, it would be like a total day in the park for you to To meet all the criteria for that But I had to train really hard to meet the swim requirements So I ended up losing a little bit of weight, but when I came out I would definitely did you mission? I lost nine pounds and it came out seven so I went in two sixteen So I went in pretty late. I'm like two twenty one now. So last year I entered the mission at 216 and I came out like 207 Which was like I thought the scale was wrong. So even though I ate a lot of calories during that mission My metabolic rate was really high
Starting point is 01:36:16
You know and that that was a consequence of that is so interesting because it's those are two completely Contradictory concepts to me on the one hand you're, my glucose levels went down, my ketone levels went up. It looked like I had fasted for a week. But of course, if you fasted for a week, your metabolic rate would be going down and not up. In fact, you would expect to see a topogy skyrocket, whereas I'm sitting here as I'm listening to you thinking, would a topogy have increased during that period of time or decreased? I think anything that pushes glucose that low
Starting point is 01:36:48
and ketones that high, and I think not really without knowing it, we're pretty task loaded, so you don't have all the time that much time to eat. I mean, part of the mission is that they're training, this is part of, it's the only NASA analog where astronauts are actually part of the crew members. Like other things like high seas mission or NASA hero mission actually uses everyday folks and they push them to the limits to see how they can break them. But the NASA NIMO mission is actually
Starting point is 01:37:15
training sort of astronauts. So they task load you to see what you're doing and you don't have a whole lot of time to eat, but I was consuming what my normal calories would be, but I was under- I underestimated my calories for this. And I think it put me in a calorie deficit, which probably decreased my testosterone. My cortisol level increased, but it was still within the normal range. And you're away from the light. So your circadian is probably a bit screwed up too, being in the end. What episode you have? You're only at like 60 feet. So you do see some of the light come down
Starting point is 01:37:51
in, but it's probably a little bit different than I'm a very light sort of sun worshipper. Like I always try to get some light in the middle, you know, in the beginning of the day, and that's part of something that I always do. So it was a bit disruptive in that sense. So let's talk about ketone esters, salts, et cetera. So to your knowledge, what's the first exogenous ketone that was ever manufactured? Is that the tally one or? Exogenous ketone manufactured.
Starting point is 01:38:16
So one three butane dial has been around a long time since the 1950s. Actually, MIT did some research as a space fuel. So there was a publication in 1975 where they were trying to identify an alternative energy fuel for long duration spaceflight and the best candidate was one three-butane dial, which is sort of a synthetic compound that breaks down completely to beta hydroxybutyrate. Meaning the liver is not required to transform it into BHB? The liver is required.
Starting point is 01:38:53
Yeah, through a couple simple steps. So sodium beta hydroxybutyrate would be the first sort of ketone, exogenous ketone that was used clinically. And there was a number of papers that utilized that for rare metabolic disorders, actually. So that would be the first one. And a lot of the IP and sort of the patents that came out were sodium beta hydroxybutyrate.
Starting point is 01:39:15
And then- Maybe explain for people what the difference is between a salt and an ester. So we'll leave acetoacetate out of that for a moment. Yeah, but if you talk about beta hydroxybutyrate. But you can have have a COS state salt too, so I can mention that so I didn't know that I thought it was only a die ester. So that's we'll definitely want to hear about that So on the BHB front people are sort of inundated with ketone salts ketone esters and then a whole bunch of complete like weird stuff like raspberry ketones and stuff
Starting point is 01:39:41
But let's just leave the nonsense off the table. Yeah, but if you just talk about comparing a ketone at BHB ester to a BHB salt, what's the chemical difference? Yeah, so a salt is just an ionic bond, right, between the ketone molecule, beta hydroxybutyrate, a monovalent or a divalent cation or an alkaline amino acid, like arginine, citralline, histidine, lysine. So you can literally, ionically bond beta hydroxybutyrate to a number of different things. The easiest thing to do is to bond it with sodium,
Starting point is 01:40:13
potassium, calcium and magnesium. Now calcium and magnesium have two positive charges. You could put two BHBs on them. Oh. That's the advantage, sort of an advantage. This advantage, I guess with magnesium BHB, which is actually, is very bioavailable magnesium. I measured my magnesium after taking it. It went up quite high.
Starting point is 01:40:35
Disadvantaged is that your GI tolerability to something like magnesium, beta hydroxybutyrate may be only somewhere between one to three grams. You know, three grams max produce. Wow, so not that much. One gram three times a day, at least for me, had no issues, I could probably tolerate two or three grams per day. So it's nice, I mean, it's something that's contributing. But ideally, what you want to do with a ketone salt is,
Starting point is 01:41:02
because salt has a stigma, I call them ketone electrolyte formulations, is to spread the beta hydroxybutyrate out across monovalent and divanlic canyons, and they're the four that have the most utility. And then an ester, of course, is a covalent bond, not an aionic bond, right? Yeah, so you can take one, three butane dial and you could create a monoester with beta hydroxybutyrate, right? And just add it do a trans-estrification reaction and Combine that beta hydroxybutyrate to one three butane dial or acetoacetate You can combine with one three buti or you could take glycerol so with glycerol you can come up with a triester Of glycerol which we have basically you're creating you can come up with a triester of glycerol,
Starting point is 01:41:45
which we have. Basically, you're creating a triglyceride that is instead of three fatty acids, you put three BHBs. It's pretty cool molecule, yeah. So we have some experience using that. So I told a story like many, many years ago, four, five years ago on Tim Ferriss's podcast
Starting point is 01:42:00
about how I drank this jet fuel and almost thought I was gonna go blind. Of course, what I may have, what I may or may not have omitted from that story was that you gave it to me. The ketones today tasted heck of a lot better than that earlier gen stuff. And even when I told you that I just took the 50 ml vial you sent and chugged it in one sitting, even you were horrified, you're like, wait, wait, you didn you didn't read the note I wrote you, explaining how to dilute it and mix it. We had talked about it. We had assuredly talked about it.
Starting point is 01:42:30
You were very enthusiastic about getting started. Yeah, I couldn't resist. I was too. That stuff's unbearably bad. Yeah. So what, I mean, whereas the ketone salts actually don't taste bad, they're obviously strong, but they're awesome.
Starting point is 01:42:44
Yeah, yeah. So why does the ester, is there an obvious reason from an olfactory slash taste perspective why they are so staggeringly horrible? Yeah, at least they were. And I mean, I'm told they're better today. Yeah, I would say the ketogenic potency is inversely proportional to taste.
Starting point is 01:43:03
So it just seems like, more potent these compounds get, even the triester of beta hydroxybutyrate, it's pretty nasty stuff. Meaning that glycerol triglycerate that? Yeah, it's a great molecule. I mean, it has lots of tremendous utility. Well, making a ketone ester with one-three butane diol is really cool because the one one three butane dial is really
Starting point is 01:43:25
cool because the one three butane dial itself is more substrate broken down. Yeah. So that goes into another question, the whole anantimer. So if you use the R beta hydroxyl butane age with the R one three butane dial, then you can really get ketone levels up pretty high. And that would be sort of the delta G or the human, you know, ketone ester that's out there. It's the R an antler. That would be the R. delta G or the human, you know, ketone ester that's out there. It's the R and Antmer. Uh, that would be the R. Yeah, the R. It's R, so you can get Reseamic-13 butane dial, but that's the R, an Antumor of 13 butane dial, with the R beta hydroxybuty.
Starting point is 01:43:58
Can we explain to everybody what R versus L means in the, in the Antmer world? So beta hydroxybuty,, not a C2S tape, but beta hydroxybutyrate has a stereo isomer. So if you put your hands together, the R beta hydroxybutyrate, or let's do D and L, let's do that. So the D would be equivalent to the R beta hydroxybutyrate would be the mirror image of the L beta hydroxybutyrate.
Starting point is 01:44:24
And the predominant form of beta hydroxybutyrate in the body is D beta hydroxybutyrate. We do have arasamase enzyme that in various tissues that can convert the D to the L. So, but when you're in nutritional ketosis or starvation ketosis, you are making D an antimer of the BHB. Predominantly, yeah, so we do have the capacity to make the L, but it's pretty, pretty minimal.
Starting point is 01:44:51
So that brings up the question. I think 99% of all the ketone salts being sold right now are racemic, so they are the D and the L. Cool, cool. Yeah, yeah, they're equal amount amount and there may be a concern there, but we don't know. So most of my research has actually been with the recemit compounds and they work great. They're puttically.
Starting point is 01:45:14
In pharmacology, there's a sorted history of getting the anantomer wrong. I mean, one of the famous stories I know of is fentanyl. Yeah, a little bit as well. Yeah. So that's right, a little bit in fentanyl as well. Yeah, so that's right, FendFendFend, where both examples of using the wrong and antimic. Yeah, many pharmaceuticals, like I think IB Profend, and I know like a Fedrin, you know, is Rhesemic,
Starting point is 01:45:34
and many of the drugs out there. So, and things like Ringer's Lactate, I think, you know, Lactate is Ringer Lactate. It's easy to do. Is it D-Now? It used to be Rhesemic. Oh, really? Yeah, I think you can get both.
Starting point is 01:45:46
Okay. So you're saying look physiologically exist at 9010, D to L, and then you're buying something racemic. You at least have to entertain the question, hey, am I ingesting something that might have a negative side effect? Yeah. And so the ketone esters, they're mirroring the physiology
Starting point is 01:46:04
or they're just going mostly D presumably. Well, the human ketone esters, they're mirroring the physiology, they're just going mostly D presumably. Well, the human ketone ester, for my understanding, is completely D. So it's produced to D beta hydroxybutyrate. Interestingly, elevating just beta hydroxybutyrate in our seizure models, even with the D does not have an anti-seizure effect. So that's actually why we went to the one-three-butane dial. Sorry, say that again.
Starting point is 01:46:25
Yeah. Would you say that if you use a pure D salt? A D salt or D, D ester. Pure D salt or pure D ester. No anti-seasure. No anti-seasure effect with beta hydroxybutyrate. We need it. And the animal models even suggest this,
Starting point is 01:46:39
if you just look, even studies beyond our study, is that you need to elevate acetoacetate as the anti-seasure effect. And we don't know exactly why that happens. The ketone ester that we work with, which is one three butane dial acetoacetate diester, elevates beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate in approximately one to one ratio. Is that what you used to give me?
Starting point is 01:47:00
Or was I just kidding? I gave you a bunch of things. What was the one that's happening? What was the one in the capsule that tasted even worse than the BHB Ester? Actually, that was the diester of a pseudo-astate. That's really potent. And it was bound to what?
Starting point is 01:47:16
It went through your handout. That shit was from another planet of bad. I still have some because... I've done shots of that. I like to just give it to people. I put many gallons of that through me and done quite a bit of blood work. And no, pretty reliably, at least in my body,
Starting point is 01:47:33
that it's not toxic and pretty much all the biomarkers go in a remarkably positive direction. But even though I know that, it's not enough for me to, to even know it has that. And that's no matter how great substance can be if it doesn't taste good, you know, even me, I'm not going to take it, you know, even on a capsule because it's an aftertaste. Exactly.
Starting point is 01:47:55
Well, I also remember you telling me, because you sent them and I was like, oh, sweet, it'll be capsules, because I had senior animal data, and I was like, I want that. And then you said, okay, well, I'll send it to you in capsules because you can't drink it, it's too bad. And I was like, perfect situation resolved. And you said, and then not entirely, you'll still taste it through the capsule. And I actually find it to be a great dinner party trick.
Starting point is 01:48:16
Like, who's the biggest tough guy here that just wants to show me how much of this stuff they can ingest? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we've done a lot of work with that Esther, and it has remarkable effects, but we think it's probably more suited for like a medical food and something that could be sort of a parental,
Starting point is 01:48:36
you know, IV therapy. So who first synthesized that? So I reached out to honorary brooding grabber at Case Western, who was the director of the Metabolomics, and I H funded, I think, Metabolomics Corps, at Case Western. And I reached out to everybody, but who had any experience,
Starting point is 01:48:58
either researching with ketone esters or synthesizing them. And he kindly gave me the recipe on how to synthesize it that was above and beyond the patent. It was actually a detailed recipe on how to use a Google Road distillation apparatus, where to get the vacuum pressure. You didn't already know how to do that? I knew it was your past. Well, actually, so Patrick Arnold, as you know, kind of helped me with the art. So an organic chemistry really is an art, you know, to be able to do this. Patrick is an artist. Patrick is an artist.
Starting point is 01:49:31
And he thought this was like shady stuff in the beginning. And I kept sending him papers. And then he realized that this could be something big, you know. He realized that the science was there. And there was a lot of big players in this field who had done remarkable research But this didn't really have what it took to like actually make it a product like synthesize it and the stuff that you actually consume I became obsessed with Patrick after all this stuff happened and Actually introduced him to Tim and in the show notes to this I'll make sure that we link to Tim's podcast with Patrick.
Starting point is 01:50:06
With Patrick. Which I'd love to have Patrick on the show at some point too to talk about this. Should this show end up persisting, but that episode with Tim and Patrick is so interesting. It's like, if you have any interest in endocrinology in sort of like how the hormones work, how steroids work, it's yeah, yeah, it's just what I character. I owe a lot to Patrick. I don't think I probably wouldn't have gotten tenure without I owe so much to him.
Starting point is 01:50:33
So I need to acknowledge him for that, that there were academic icons out there who could not do what Patrick did for me. And he was pretty persistent in doing it, too. So he synthesized first the monoester, and then it was a mix of monoester and diester, but he nailed it down to, you know, ultimately getting the art of the organic chemistry to where it's pretty much pure diester.
Starting point is 01:50:59
He's such a wonderful human being. Anytime I email Patrick a question, which invariably I do have, like clinically, I'll have a question about a hormonor and they'll be like, there's no textbook that knows the answer, there's no paper that knows the answer, I'm like, Patrick, I got a crazy question for you. And it's like, even if he doesn't know the answer, I mean, he'll have a more thoughtful insight than you can get anywhere. And it speaks to his capabilities. So, first of all, you've shared with me something I didn't actually know today that's really
Starting point is 01:51:25
interesting, which is this notion that if you are purely using the D and Antimer, you do not get any of the anti-seizure benefits, whereas if you're at 90-10, presumably you're getting them. So you don't need a lot of the L, but you need some of L. Yeah, I don't think there's any studies that show using an exogenous ketone in the form of pure beta hydroxybutyrate is beneficial. So what we do know is that when you deliver exogenous ketones in a beta hydroxybutyrate to a pseudo-acetate ratio of 1 to 1, that has pretty remarkable anti-seasure effects.
Starting point is 01:51:59
And there was some studies that were done with aceto-acetate and also some studies that were done with acetyl acetate, and also some studies that were done with acetone, showing anti-seizure effects. So I do think acetyl acetate is necessary. So what we don't know, I don't think that Rhesemic salts or Rhesemic esters, or esters that produce both D and L beta hydroxybutyrate are a concern. I have not seen data to suggest that these would be a health concern.
Starting point is 01:52:32
There are companies out there that are selling 8 million sort of doses per month of salts that are racemic in nature, and there have been sort of no consequences from that, that have been reported. So how are so many companies able to do this? Is there no IP in the salt world anymore? I don't think there is IP. I think some of the early patents may expired, so I don't think there's some intellectual property with formulations of a ketone salt and a ketogenic
Starting point is 01:53:02
fat in MCT and that's some of the stuff that my university has. And there's some composition matter patterns and maybe some use patterns around the D salts, I think. And maybe the D ketone esters. So at this point in time, do you think that the ketone salts have more physiologic benefit than the ketone esters, just as a function of having a higher amount of the L and the antimer.
Starting point is 01:53:25
So I think when it comes to purely a metabolic fuel, I think the debate of hydroxybutyrate has some advantages, right? So we also know that in regards to some of the signaling effects, especially the inflammation, the NLRP3 in flamizome is suppressed by beta hydroxyl butorate, both the D and the L form. And we know that when we consume Rhesemic ketone salts in the D and L form, the L form tends to stick around longer and get some metabolized slower. So conceivably, that could be having a stronger anti-inflammatory effect because you have a ketone body and endogenous metabolite that's functioning as a very powerful signaling molecule that's suppressing
Starting point is 01:54:14
an inflammatory pathway. So the concentration just tends to get hired. That's my view of it. So we haven't really studied that in detail, but the lab that did some of the work on showing the nature medicine paper that showed the NLRP3 flamazon was suppressed by beta hydroxybutyrate, it occurred both in the D and the L form. We do know that the L form gets metabolized slower. So the concentrations in the tissue may actually reach higher levels. So what we have observed is that the Rhesemic beta hydroxybutyrate has a glucose lowering effect. So we're trying to figure out. But we also see that in the pure de-air-2.
Starting point is 01:54:57
And the pure de-air-2. Yep. I've seen that with the human product, which is obviously a pure de-PHB. I think they're seeing about a 20 to 30% reduction in glucose. Do you see more in the RISemic? It tends to be the case, yeah, it tends to be the case, especially with one-three-butane dial. You see it. And maybe it's a redox shift in the liver. That's what honorary brooding grabber thought, but it's pretty remarkable. And when we compare, so I have some products in my bag, I'll give you, I have, I've
Starting point is 01:55:25
been doing a lot of work with desalts. So I've been consuming desalts in pretty high levels that bring my ketone levels up pretty close to an ester. So you can formulate sort of which in use is how high. If the elevation of my ketones gets more than 3 millimolar, I just start feeling a little bit weird, Which is interesting because you've experienced naturally occurring ketones at much higher than that level. Yeah, but I don't actually have a pretty good ketone burner. So, you could do a glucose tolerance test. I do a ketone tolerance test.
Starting point is 01:55:57
A ketone tolerance test is consuming a known amount of ketones and looking at that pharmacokinetic curve. So, you measure, so you'll do fasting level of BHP glucose insulin for fatty acid, ingest your ketone, and then measure at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes. And athletes have, when you challenge them with a ketone tolerance test, I'm creating like a new test here, they actually dispose of ketones and utilize it remarkably effectively. When you take a couch potato, and this the same as the couch potato rats, you could push a couch potato rat into ketoacidosis if they're older.
Starting point is 01:56:35
Their tissues are not effectively utilizing the ketones for fuel. And I've seen that in some individuals and some people, I get hundreds of emails and people who show me their data. And one packet of even a commercial ketone product on the market can shoot some people, I get hundreds of emails and people who show me their data. And one packet of even a commercial ketone product on the market can shoot some people up to like five or six, which is like that. And just to be clear, in the ketone tolerance test, which by the way, I freaking love this idea. How have you not told me that until today?
Starting point is 01:56:59
Holding out on your best stuff. It's just materialized in my brain. What am I gonna call it? I don't know, but you next time you get one of these ideas, just pick up the phone. You know my number. You call me and you tell me this stuff. It's like you're holding out on it. I just want to make sure I understand something.
Starting point is 01:57:13
Is this independent of whether or not that athlete was in ketosis before or after? In other words, how much of that utilization is a function of the metabolic machinery in the muscle to utilize ketone versus, hey, athletes are just better at oxidation to begin with. Fat adapted athletes are very good ketone utilizers and have a hard time elevating their ketone levels with the ketogenic diets sometimes. If you take a high carb athlete who's still fit as a fiddle, and you do this test, how do they behave?
Starting point is 01:57:43
Not as well. I do think that high-performing athletes probably are bouncing in and out of ketosis, right? You have post-exercise ketosis just from the energy depletion that you get during exercise. Their bodies are probably used to seeing ketones using them as fuel, but if you take someone who's a real keto adapted fat burning like ketone machine and you hit them with high doses of ketones, they tend to dispose of them very quickly. So they've upregulated ketone transport across membranes, across the blood brain barrier
Starting point is 01:58:17
through the MCT transporters, which are upregulated. And this of course is not the same MCT that we talked about earlier. No, these are mono-carboxylic acid transporters. It also transport things like lactate and pyruvate. And because the MCT transporters are much higher and more dense in the membrane, you could probably clear lactate faster. So I think that may contribute, in part, to why keto-adapted athletes produce less lactate.
Starting point is 01:58:42
It's funny you say that. I hadn't thought of that, actually. I didn't realize that in ketosis, you upregulate MCT. I've always suspected that that might play a role in the genetic differences between athletes. Why do some athletes seem virtually unparallized by anaerobic activity?
Starting point is 01:58:59
And it's like, look, if you can shuttle lactate out of the cell quick enough, you can recycle it and reuse it. We actually tried to get an IRB of an NF1, a guy named Ryan Flarity, who I don't know if you know Ryan. You'll know of him, yeah. So Ryan and I, and a couple of other guys, tried to get an NF1 IRB at UCSD to do muscle biopsies on ourselves, pre and post a certain type of nutrition,
Starting point is 01:59:25
exercise routine we wanted to implement that Ryan has sort of pioneered with a number of endurance athletes. And that was one of our endpoints was, could we see an upregulation of MCT because the hypothesis was the certain type of training stress was gonna lead to that, which would obviously increase our performance at a certain level of output, but super interesting to think about that through the level of the ketone potentially enhancing
Starting point is 01:59:50
that signaling. Yeah, it is a lot of things to think about there. So I'm going to caveat my next question with a really serious caveat, but it's also a very serious question, and I was sort of on the fence about whether I'd ask you this or not, but I'm going to say screw it, I'm going to ask you anyway. I'm going to caveat this by giving the disclaimer, which is your PhD scientist, you do basic research. You are not an MD. You are not an oncologist. And nothing you say is going to be construed as medical advice.
Starting point is 02:00:16
So with that said, I still have to ask you a question, which is, if tomorrow, you, your wife, someone you cared about deeply was diagnosed with cancer. And it was a cancer for which all standard therapies had been exhausted. And you are now left to the best insights you have with respect to your knowledge of cancer metabolism. Tell me what pulling out all the stops looks like. And again, this is in the context of you've taken and you are complying with all chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, surgical therapy, etc. But you're
Starting point is 02:00:50
losing, right? So something else needs to be done. What is that combination of that something look like? So, I guess, I mean, when we think about the worst cancer, worst case scenario, who'd have pancreatic is pretty bad, but probably glial blastoma would top the list of things, right? And would your answer be different if I was asking you about pancreatic adenocarcinoma versus GBM? I think, you know, it would be, there's things like with pancreatic cancer can make it hard
Starting point is 02:01:16
for someone to fall the ketogenic diet, right? Because, and liver cancer and things like that. So they need to approach it a little bit different and you can have a lot of unexpected consequences, metabolic consequences by someone with liver cancer. If they have heavy liver mets, or... So let's make it simpler.
Starting point is 02:01:33
Let's bring cancers. Let's talk about GBM and metastatic breast cancer. Okay. Okay, so start with GBM. Here, you loved one or you have GBM? Yeah, I would say it would be useful, not necessarily, you know, absolutely necessary, to ask for an FDG PET scan, do a PET CT, especially, I mean with GBM it's going to light up, lighters
Starting point is 02:01:53
no tomorrow. Right, so just for the listener, so FDG PET means you take glucose, you label glucose with a molecule. You're going to be able to. Yeah, and then when you do the PET scan, shows by lighting up anything that absorbs that and the most rapidly metabolizing tissues of glucose light that up, which is almost always any cancer, and then a brain normally lights up, so a brain with cancer takes that to another level. So you're doing that to document that this is a high glycolytic tumor. Yeah. Okay. So even now,
Starting point is 02:02:23
there's a lot of experimental things going on for GBM but pretty much the standard of care is not offering any survival advantage when it comes to this. So we did GBM is uniformly fatal. I believe the five the five year survival is almost zero. Yeah. Yep. And the mutation rate in GBM is it's they're very very heterogeneous in regards to the number of mutations. So many of the standard care therapies that target specific pathways just are not efficacious because you have grossly mutated cells throughout the tumor. So I'd probably, my answer would default back to this press pulse idea that we published in Nutrition and Metabolism.
Starting point is 02:03:08
Is that the one in 2017? No, actually, the 2017 paper was in seminars and cancer, and that was with oncologists at the Moffitt Cancer Center, where we discuss how the ketogenic diet essentially targets the warberg effect, and in doing so, really targets all the hallmarks of cancer. So any cancer biologist, you know, is writing a review on paper, like, you know, you talk about the hallmarks of cancer. There's enhanced proliferation, evasion of immune system, angiogenesis, all these different things, evasion of apoptosis, the ketogenic diet,
Starting point is 02:03:47
nutritional ketosis actually targets all those things and even the aberrant metabolism and the increase in inflammation that is now a hallmark of cancer. So from the press pulse, the simplest way to describe it, at least its implementation, which I think is probably most important for the listeners, is to achieve a glucose ketone index. So press essentially means you were providing metabolic stress to the cancer cells that can stop their rapid growth and proliferation.
Starting point is 02:04:18
It's like taking your foot off the gas pedal of cancer cell growth. And there's a number of things that we could do to slow down cancer growth and proliferation and metabolically stress those cancer cells. And that can be done continuously. And pulse protocols, you have a wide expanding toolbox of modalities that can be used in an intermittent fashion that can be sort of tactically used at different time points to kill off the cancer cells that you have applied the press stress to.
Starting point is 02:04:54
So press protocols, which are done continuously, would be something like a calorie restricted ketogenic diet, perhaps with intermittent fasting, perhaps a low-dose metformin. And what was the ketone to glucose ratio that you want to see? I would want to see anywhere between a maintenance of 1 to 2. Meaning that's the glucose to ketone ratio. A daily maintenance of 1 to 2, yeah. So glucose should never be more than twice the ketone level when both are measured in millimolar.
Starting point is 02:05:25
Yeah, ideally in a perfect scenario, three millimolar ketones, three millimolar glucose. So that's kind of hard to achieve, but not with a number of tools. So there's a number of tools that you can use to achieve that. And that needs to, and there are things that we could talk about too. So the fastest way to get to a glucose ketone index and maintain that of one to two would be what I would call supplemented ketogenic intermittent fasting. When you eat within a restricted time window, say of like six hours a day, you start eating at 2 p.m. and finish at 8 p.m.M seems relatively easy to do.
Starting point is 02:06:05
And within that fasting window, if needed, you could consume calories in the form of perhaps exogenous ketones. And that would further lower glucose and elevate ketone levels, like within a range. And they are commercially available ketone products on the market. Millions are being consumed, and there's no kind of adverse effects. When you compare it to something like a red bull, which you'll find lots of adverse effects.
Starting point is 02:06:32
So there's fairly good safety data, but this needs to be said. But the difference is red bull sponsors a formula one team. So it's gotta be better. Yeah, so these things are relatively safe, and their utility are that they can help you achieve a glucose ketone index. And when you do have a glucose ketone index Things are relatively safe and their utility are that they can help you achieve agglucose ketone index.
Starting point is 02:06:47
When you do have agglucose ketone index of one to two, you are limiting fermentable fuels to the cancer cells and also most likely suppressing the hormone insulin tremendously to get there. Because I'm sure you'll be asked or I'll be asked, is the reason you are applying an intermittent or time restricted feeding algorithm to this because during the fasted time you increase ketogenesis or because there was something specific about having complete liver and gut rest? In other words, is there a reason that an individual should or should not consume exogenous ketones and or MCT during the fasting window? Yeah, I think if it's difficult for them to achieve a glucose ketone index of one to two, one of the tools in the toolbox could be to consume exogenous ketones during that fasting period.
Starting point is 02:07:36
I think it can be help. And you can also consume them during the feeding period too. And they provide an extra source of calories that's a non-fermentable fuel, and they think have a benefits in and of itself. You can just talk about the anti-inflammatory benefits, you know. I think there's a number of different benefits. So that's- So that's- Press protocol is pretty aggressive. Yeah, and it could also- I'm under things like meditation and yoga, I mean, and exercise, of course, low intensity exercise, I think. But the most important thing from my perspective of the press, so we're just talking about the press, is to get that glucose ketone index.
Starting point is 02:08:14
To put it one or better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, one or two are better. And then once that is achieved or concurrently, so you could think about different modalities for the pulse protocol. So changing your metabolic physiology with what we just described will have a huge effect on targeting the Warburg effect and also will be already targeting all the hallmarks of cancer. So you have a different person.
Starting point is 02:08:42
You have just changed that person's metabolism, you know. I mean, the glucose ketone index of the average joe out on the street is probably something you have a different person. You have just changed that person's metabolism. I mean, the glucose ketone index of the average joe out on the street is probably something like 25 or 50. It's like nowhere near that. So you are literally changing the metabolic physiology of that person.
Starting point is 02:08:57
So modalities that they may be resistant to or completely failed may have an effect now. So chemo, radiation, maybe immune-based may have an effect now. So chemo radiation, maybe immune-based therapies may be working now. But it's an important point, right? We view this as an as an as an as so you could do a neoagevant concurrent or adjuvant approach. So I think that what I just described can be used as a neoagevant concurrent and an adjuvant approach. Yeah. So people talk about
Starting point is 02:09:24
cancer approaches as, look, you want to think about the legs of a stool. So you take a chemotherapeutic approach, you take a radiation approach, you take an immune-based approach, and you take a surgical approach. Those are really the four pillars of cancer treatment today. Yeah.
Starting point is 02:09:39
You're basically saying, look, there needs to be a new type of oncologist, which is the metabolic oncologist. So you have a surgical oncologist. Absolutely. You have a radiation oncologist, which is the metabolic oncologist. So you have a surgical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, you have a medical oncologist, you know, have an immuno oncologist. Why don't we have a metabolic oncologist? Yeah, things will lead that way. And just by the research that's being done now, the huge amount of research being done,
Starting point is 02:09:59
even on oncometabolites and all the genetics people are now focusing on the how metabolism is influencing genetics. The metabolism is a driver for our biology and influencing epigenetic expression. So, you know, the work, I'd like to also point to the work of a friend of mine and colleague, Adrian Shek, who did her work at the Barron Neurological Institute,
Starting point is 02:10:24
which demonstrated in a mouse model GL261, I think, model of glioblastoma that using temazolamide and also radiation with really focusing on radiation, that being in a state of nutritional ketosis made radiation therapy many, many times more efficacious. In that mouse model, which is kind of a gold standard model for GBM, it actually cured the GBM in that mouse model, using the ketogenic diet combined with whole brain radiation. So that was a pretty significant finding
Starting point is 02:11:01
that actually spearheaded some of the ketogenic diet clinical research. And in her research, this was done with dietary or nutritional ketosis, not exogenous supplementation. Not it, she went on to do some work with exogenous ketones and looking at how ketones can reprogram the metabolism and ketones can actually have, they are like cox2 inhibitors, they inhibit reactive oxygen species, which is driving growth and proliferation. So that work spawned research just on ketones by themselves
Starting point is 02:11:34
in her animal model. So what is in your pulse protocol then? Pulse protocol can be varied. So hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At what frequency? Three, generally speaking. So with the GBM, you have to, so a consequence of a GBM could be seizures, right?
Starting point is 02:11:50
So getting hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a GBM is gonna be tricky. So yes, you have to start very low, probably like somewhere around 1.5, ATA, and then work up gradually from there, based on the individual person. But generally speaking, the research that we did showed that not five days a week, which is typically used for wound healing, but I do think there needs to be a day off for adaptive effects to happen.
Starting point is 02:12:18
So three days a week, 2.5 atmospheres, for 60 minutes, three times a week. That produces, well, reverse tumor hypoxia for one thing. Hyperbaric oxygen increases tissue oxygenation not by hyperoxygenating hemoglobin, but it actually gets oxygen into the plasma. That's a very important thing because- Meaning you solubilize oxygen within the plasma. And that's a very important thing because meaning you solubilize oxygen within the plasma. Yes. Cause you can't really super saturate the hemoglobin. Yeah.
Starting point is 02:12:50
Much more here at the top of the curve. Yeah. You and I are sitting here. I don't know with this air here, but you're your hemoglobin is essentially saturated. Yeah. Probably 96 98%. But the hyper oxygenation that occurs with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. And this is why oxygen therapy does not work independent of an increase in pressure, right? So the increase in pressure is needed to dry the oxygen into the plasma. And once it's in the plasma, tumors have a radic vasculature, right?
Starting point is 02:13:20
And then the red blood cells get caught inside the capillaries and the vascular and the oxygen doesn't get into the tissue inside the tumor. But if the oxygen is in the plasma, it can get passed and all into the nooks and crannies of the tumor and then reverse tumor hypoxia, which is tumor hypoxia is driving HIF1 alpha and VEGF and causing. Oh, that's so interesting. So ironically, you're taking something that is initially a deficit of cancer, which is its hypoxia, but then it utilizes it as it's an advantage by saying, hey, I'm gonna work around this.
Starting point is 02:13:55
It's gonna make me more resilient. It's gonna allow me to increase my vascular, your boomerang, you're saying, hey buddy, that little advantage you had that was a disadvantage, we're gonna reverse it. We're gonna hyper-oxygenate you now. We're going to take away your hypoxia. Also in close to free run.
Starting point is 02:14:08
Yes. So you have a dual effect, right? So you are silencing the oncogenes. You're turning off some of the oncogenes. And also by hyperoxygenating a tumor, which its baseline is to be in a state of hypoxia by super saturating the tumor with oxygen. And that tumor tissue has damaged mitochondria because hypoxia damages the mitochondria. So basically, you're hyperoxygenating a whole bunch of damaged mitochondria.
Starting point is 02:14:38
And essentially what that does is skyrockets, superoxide anion, which then through fentin chemistry. So when you have a lot of free iron, and all that you got a whole bunch of hemen stuff that's being broken down the tumor, so you have a lot of free iron driving the fentiner action, which is producing hydroxyl radicals, and that causes a massive oxidative stress, specifically to the tumor, and you're delivering a massive oxidative stress to the tumor while it's relatively nontoxic to healthy cells that have normal metabolism. Because the tumor is thriving in a low oxygen environment and you're reversing tumor hypoxia and hyperoxygenating it, and you have this environment which is just fueling redox stress, you can then trigger apoptosis
Starting point is 02:15:26
and endocrosis, really driving necrosis in these tumor cells. So hyperbacoxygen delivered at the maximum tolerable dose three times per week. And you could further enhance the oxidative stress of the tumor by something that's a lot of people who haven't heard of this, but IV vitamin C, so vitamin C, if given intravenously, at about-
Starting point is 02:15:50
You could give a lot up to about 100 grams at that. You could, yeah, 25 to 100 grams is kind of pushing it, but vitamin C, a scorbit acid, also functions as a glucose antagonist. So you've gotta make sure you have dextrose on hand if patients- Yeah, but not if you're in a state of ketosis, right? So if you're in a state of ketosis, so I did a pretty high dose vitamin C, but being in a state of ketosis, you can tolerate higher amounts, right? You know what your glucose
Starting point is 02:16:15
dropped to? So when you measure your glucose, when you're getting vitamin C, you get a false positive on the meter. Falsely high? You get falsely high. Well, at least the abit precision extrace. Yeah, yeah. It's just, you know, when you measure that meter, that assay on the meter is also sensitive to the pH of your blood too, and there's a redox shift.
Starting point is 02:16:39
And a scorbic acid is a powerful reducing agent, and that might be altering the assay. So it's not able to get get my glucose like skyrocket. I know I went into a hypoglycemic, but my ketones were elevated, and I took a pretty big hit of vitamin C, and I was just doing it just for the self experimentation thing. Right, so what's the thought here?
Starting point is 02:16:59
So lots of people talked about. Oxidative stress. So vitamin C driving the fentanyl action to produce more oxidative stress. So vitamin C driving the fentanyl action to produce more oxidative stress. So vitamin C is a pro-oxidant. When you get blood levels of vitamin C in the millimolar concentration, then it becomes a pro-oxidant.
Starting point is 02:17:15
It's not an antioxidant. So we're not using antioxidants or definitely you don't want to use antioxidants. Yeah, I was going to come back to that. But the next thing is, I'm sure somebody listening to this is going to say, well, I don't have access to IV vitamin C if I wanted to do that. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. You can't do it all the way through. which is, again, highly counterintuitive to most people. We're hardwired to think that there's nothing better
Starting point is 02:17:45
for you than antioxidants. Yeah. But paradoxically, once you have cancer, that might not be the case. Yeah, so I think antioxidants may be blocking some of the efficacy of some of the therapies, too, right? Because many chemotherapy drugs, their function works through enhancing oxidative stress,
Starting point is 02:18:03
radiation sure does. So radiation, maybe 20% of the cancer killing effects of radiation are due to damaging the DNA with double strand nicks, but 80% of the tumor killing effect of radiation is by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Now does that mean you can't have blueberries and things that have low levels of antioxidants? I would say no, but you don't want to kind of saturate your body with a cocktail of antioxidants.
Starting point is 02:18:33
Like you don't want to do a glutathione push, right? After you do- Same with an AC. Same with an AC. So you wouldn't have an AC. I personally would not. I don't think that none of the cancer studies in animal models or humans are none of the cancer studies and animal models or humans are supportive of the use of antioxidants. And that was a big focus of me. I mean, during
Starting point is 02:18:51
my PhD, I wanted to do a post-doc research in antioxidant cocktails that were going to save the world. And none of the research on antioxidants really panned out in my mind. There's a couple things, you know, maybe for mitochondrial antioxidants for like, free drinks ataxia and maybe ALS and some research there, but it's pretty subtle benefits. But in the context of cancer, no, I don't, I think antioxidant should be avoided. Anything else in your pulse protocol? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things that you could add. So with the press protocol, I think a low dose of metformin could be helpful too.
Starting point is 02:19:27
So that will activate AMP kinase, maybe decrease insulin a little bit, maybe increase ketones a little bit too. And it's just a readily available, cheap drug that has a very good safety profile, 500 milligrams to 2000 milligrams a day are usually well tolerated, probably starting with 500 milligrams and working up. But when it comes to the pulse protocol, hyperbaric oxygen, IV vitamin C, and there are a number of drugs that we're working with
Starting point is 02:19:57
now. One would be 2D oxyglucos, which in and of itself, from a seizure world, and I've been a reviewer for the government for different grants and stuff, and this is in the context of epilepsy, 2DG is sort of like the ketogenic diet in a drug. So by inhibiting glycolysis, it has, this gets back to the question, right? You have no ketones, but you inhibit like elitic pathways.
Starting point is 02:20:24
Perhaps even like, reduce sort of, um, tour signaling or some glycolytic signal, and that may have anti-seizure effects. So 2DG is something that we're working with now. I think as- What was 2DG originally developed for, pharmacologically? I tend to look for a long time.
Starting point is 02:20:40
I think maybe it was just in the realm of experimental compound, but I know there's phase two trials in cancer. The problem is it becomes cardiotoxic above, say, 50 milligrams per kilogram. I know there's some evidence that cardiotoxicity, but at 25 milligrams per kilogram, at least on some of the grants that I reviewed. That was how to pretty good safety profile for epilepsy. So you know, not making any recommendations out there, but I think 25 milligrams per
Starting point is 02:21:13
kilogram seems to be within the realm of therapeutic efficacy and safety. And this is being studied in humans and they're out of phase one. So this, you have phase one data to support that. And the epilepsy world. Yeah, and I think there's some cancer trials going on too. And I do think that synergizes really well once you create the environment where you put the press protocol into action, then the cancer cells become even very selectively vulnerable to other things.
Starting point is 02:21:42
Like 2DG will inhibit a glycolytic pathway that drives the pentose phosphate pathway, and that pentose phosphate pathway is responsible for enhancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity of cells. So it makes the cancer cells even more vulnerable to oxidative stress, the more you can inhibit the glycolytic pathways. So 2DG, 2 dichloroacetate is something that we've worked with, 2 inhibits PDH complex. And that can also... Is DCA a drug that's been on the market for a long time?
Starting point is 02:22:16
It's a small molecule. Yeah, it's been on the market for a very long time. And what's its normal use? Its normal use is lactic acidosis, actually. So one of the side effects of metformin, right, is once you start increasing the dose of metformin and escalating the dose, the problem that you run into, it's a very powerful activator of AMP kinase. Its effects are primarily through the liver, you know, inhibiting gluconeogenesis and it's a mitochondrial toxin
Starting point is 02:22:47
through we published a paper that it increases Ross production from the complex one of the mitochondria. So it's inhibiting complex one, correct? It's inhibiting, yeah mildly inhibiting complex one and it's triggering what the cell experiences as an energetic crisis and that,, and then it has an activation of AMP kinase-2. So you are creating a scenario where that's putting a lot of persistent metal bulk stress on the tumor cells, and then you come in here with different modalities that have
Starting point is 02:23:19
overlapping but independent mechanisms at producing oxidative stress. So hyperbric oxygen, IV vitamin C, and then cancer specific, like the lidic inhibitors, 2D oxyglucose, 3 bromo pyruvate, and lognitamine. Lognitamine is also hexakines 2 inhibitor, and those three drugs that I mentioned right there, they are very powerful, and they need to probably be used in two weeks on, two weeks off. And somebody's listening to this and they're thinking, well, how the heck could I ever do this?
Starting point is 02:23:52
Are there physicians out there who are obviously doing this under the full and legal umbrella of ethical medical practice? Is everything you're talking about purely theoretical or are there ways to actually have these things implemented? I think there are some physicians out there that are probably not making it public, but I think they are getting success with doing 25% of what I just talked about. You know, they're not doing all these things, but everything that I just mentioned is readily available.
Starting point is 02:24:25
I mean, you could most of the compounds in IV vitamin C, hyperbarycoxygen therapy can be costly if you don't have a hard shell chamber. But I like that with radiation, if you're giving radiation to your body, it's like going in there with a flame thrower and you have a lot of collateral damage, whereas hyperbaric oxygen naturally elevates the precursor for oxygen-free radicals and the cancer cells selectively produce more oxygen-free radicals. So it's a very gentle approach. And instead of thinking that we should just go in there and eradicate the tumor, I think
Starting point is 02:25:02
it's more appropriate to give sort of a gentle stress to the tumor. So the therapy that I'm describing, if the patient goes into it, they're going to come out of it stronger than they were going into it. When you fat-adapt and keto-adapt your body, so many metabolic barri markers start to go in the right direction, when you go in for chemotherapy and radiation and you measure things after your body's world, you're a big inflammatory mess. I mean, you're metabolically deranged, you're insulin resistant, you are pushing things,
Starting point is 02:25:34
and you have chemo brain on top of that that may not be reversible. The suppression of your immune system with chemo is setting you up for more cancers, potentially other cancers. So the scenario that we envision is a comprehensive metabolic-based therapy where you go into it and it's a more gradual process and you start adding these modalities sort of as you go. Get the patient acclimated with that glucose ketone index of 1 two, and then start utilizing some of these other therapies. You could potentially put someone on an IV, right, and pulse a low dose of insulin to make them hypoglycemic, even one or two millimolar, and then deliver some of these agents where you've really restricted the fermentable fuels.
Starting point is 02:26:23
So I was, you know, I'm a reviewer on different manuscripts that are coming in and some of these academic and clinical oncologists are actually suggesting this and you know, medical hypothesis papers now. And that's kind of counterintuitive because you'd think, well, we don't have the last thing you want to do for a tumor is give it insulin
Starting point is 02:26:41
because this is pulsatile. And it's acute and the amount of insulin, it's not like 20 IUs, it's something like one or two IUs. So the patient comes in fasted and you give them just a little bit and that's facilitating, mostly facilitating glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle. So making it less available for the tumor, right? And that creates a scenario where you produce, severe what would typically be fatal hypoglycemia, and you could deliver ketones, you know, as an insurance, and also
Starting point is 02:27:13
deliver some of these agents that would, you'd probably dramatically sensitize that tumor tissue to the other modalities. And I know, so, mean what I didn't talk about when I did this seven day fast, like years ago, I brought my glucose levels down really low and I got to a glucose ketone index of one, or maybe even a little bit lower than one. So you were about what three to four on each of them? Yeah, well my ketones were about four or five and my glucose got down to three. So that was the lowest I ever like captured. And that was just a seven day fast.
Starting point is 02:27:48
Yeah, after seven day fast, you know, after a bris walk at the end. So I never got like ketone seven or eight, like I got it like four, you know, after like a long fast. But then I did inspired by the K-Hill study. I used various strategies to bring my glucose level down, you know, pharmacological strategies, and I did it slowly.
Starting point is 02:28:10
And just do me a favor, dumb. I really would be kind of pissed off if you like, off to yourself doing dumb shit because I think the world kind of needs you to stick around. So yeah, see if you can just maybe get an IRB to do this in the mice or something. Yeah. There's nothing that would break my heart more than getting a call from your wife saying, yeah, Dom died of some freak hypoglycemic crazy accident.
Starting point is 02:28:34
What's the longest fast you've ever done? Well, that was it, actually. Seven days. So yeah, and I was pretty adapted. And the point I was kind of getting to that, I brought my glucose down to where it was not even measurable, but with exogenous ketones, I was the meter didn't even read it. So that, to me, and I did that years ago, that motivated me more to basically focus on this area of research as sort of like my life research, because it validated to me that
Starting point is 02:29:03
this should not be happening, and ketones are an alternative energy source that can be utilized in these metabolic-based therapies that can be game changers for a bit. And we also studied glucose transporter type one deficiency syndrome, right, which is the inability and people who have let one D don't get cancer to my knowledge. I've talked to the doctors and they've never
Starting point is 02:29:25
came across anyone with glucose transporter. So that's kind of motivating too, that you can create a therapy for that, that could sort of be a magic bullet. Well, what's interesting is this is sort of in many ways old school science, right, where scientists would begin by sort of experimenting on themselves, identifying unnatural or extreme physiologic conditions that are not predicted by the current understanding. Yeah. And then that sort of provokes further investigation. Remind me again at the end of that seven day fast, how much did you deadlift? Yeah, I did 500 pounds for 10, and then I did sort of 500 pounds for 10. And then I did sort of a one rep at the end,
Starting point is 02:30:05
it was six plates or a 585. But that's below my normal, but it was amazing to me that, I didn't want to push my body too hard, but it was amazing that that amount of fasting does not really impact your strength. How much of a ridiculous, so what was your max at that time?
Starting point is 02:30:22
At that time, what was tinkering around with like, Q-Jank dying to fasting a lot, but that time? At that time, what was tinkering around with like, you know, Q-Jank dying to fasting a lot, but within a year of that time, I forget if it was before after I did 675 for five, and maybe five, I did 554, and eight to 10. So I did, you know, an extra plate for eight to 10, but I went into this basically, I felt like it did more.
Starting point is 02:30:46
I could have done more, but I just wanted to stop. I didn't want to hurt myself, because I knew I was pushing the limits at that point. And I didn't get sore at all. So I did that, and it wasn't like my body was broken down and sort of in a depleted state where I was wasted the next day. I felt I didn't even have to recover from that.
Starting point is 02:31:02
Like I had no lower back soreness the next day after that. So I probably was like, I probably couldn't want heavier. But it was just validation to me that if you're in a keto adapted state, your body is very resilient. From a military standpoint, too, which we work pretty closely with the military, I'm trying to sort of get them to understand this idea that if you are fat and keto adapted and you're faced in all steer conditions with limited food availability, you could maintain your physical and cognitive resilience in those conditions, which is pretty clear to me.
Starting point is 02:31:38
I was pretty much obsessed with eating like six meals a day for many years and it was very liberating not to have to do that now. And I'm amazed at how little I can eat once you're cute to adapt it and maintain, you know, your size and your strength. I'm not trying to be big anymore or anything or try to do any records in the gym, but it's amazing how easy it is to maintain
Starting point is 02:31:59
once your body is adapted. You've been so generous with your time. I want to sort of let you get on your way. I know you've got a long drive potentially tonight. But I want to ask you a question or a couple maybe, what do you believe today to be true that five years ago you did not believe to be true? Let's keep it within the purview
Starting point is 02:32:16
of your ketogenic life. What today do you think? Things that really, I would say, when I got into this field, I was really fascinated and immersed in this idea as ketones as an alternative energy source. So it's even like space food, you know, and we're still working on that front. But then over the last five years the observation that beta hydroxybutyrate is a powerful endogenous metabolite that's also
Starting point is 02:32:47
a signaling molecule through its H-dactivity, histone acetylase activity. More recently, we've been working with an organization that the name of the organization is called All Things Kabuki. So there's a rare genetic disease called Kabuki syndrome, which is a gene defect in the KMT2D, which is essentially an acetylase enzyme, and a defect in that gene, or that protein, creates an imbalance between gene expression and gene repression. And in the mouse model of kabuki syndrome, two things have worked in this mouse model. One is a histone acetylase inhibitor, HDAG inhibitor called AR42, which restores neurons in the
Starting point is 02:33:34
dentate gyros and kind of silences the pathological features in this mouse model. And another thing is nutritional ketosis. So nutritional ketosis, functioning as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, basically salvages or rescues the phenotype of this. And circumvents this gene mutation, the KMT2D mutation. The animals have a normal neuronal density and the dentate gyros, and even from a behavioral characteristic and enhances sort of learning and memory. So this idea that an endogenous metabolite can epigenetically sort of control gene transcription.
Starting point is 02:34:19
So I believe it's probably not unique to beta hydroxybutyrate. I think metabolites, we know that's true for acetyl CoA and other things, are epigenetic drivers. And I think they are really, they call the shots. So you can even take a step back and say the mitochondria kind of call the shots too, right? Because I think mitochondrial health and mitochondrial vitality would be the ultimate tumor suppressor. So if the bioenergetic capacity of a cell in tissues are maintained to a high degree, that bioenergetic efficiency is going to preserve genome stability and be far less likely
Starting point is 02:34:56
to trigger oncogenes at the level of the DNA. So when it comes to something like Kabuki syndrome, you have a persistent molecular genetic pathology that's silenced by the elevation of beta hydroxybutyrate functioning in a metabolic impendent way. Yeah, it's HDAQ activity. So that, to me, is like mind blowing and I think that's the direction kind of our lab is going into now. I'm always fascinating with developing alternative energy substrates and alternative fuels
Starting point is 02:35:28
as a form of nutrition for tactical applications, space applications maybe, but this idea that you could develop and even engineer nutrition to have powerful effects on gene transcription and epigenetic regulation is something I would have never predicted. That's an amazing answer actually, because, and I know that was probably a little hard for some people to follow, so what you're basically saying is,
Starting point is 02:35:56
look, five years ago, you were completely intrigued and blown away by the metabolic properties of these ketones, primarily as an alternative energy source, and with that comes a lot of interesting stuff we've talked about. But at this HDAQ pathway, this inhibition of something that can result in epigenetic change or activation of, in this case, you can basically take a germline acquired mutation and silence it with an epigenetic overlay that seems to be signaled by something as simple as ketones. And Dr. Verden at the Buck Institute
Starting point is 02:36:33
has spoken quite a bit about this as well. I mean, this really is one of those moments where you think, holy cow, we are really at the, just at the cusp of learning about this stuff. And if there's one reason to make sure we don't off ourselves with self experiments, it's to make sure we can stick around long enough to do this. Don, I'm working people follow you socially and then maybe more importantly see what you're doing from a research perspective. Sure. So the site I maintain for informational purposes would be ketonutrition.org.
Starting point is 02:37:07
It's a .org, not .com. And on that website, I have a list of podcasts. There's nutrition consultants, resources like the Charlie Foundation, which is an incredible resource that I've helped them do some educational work and gym abrums of the Charlie Foundation. It's really created an amazing resource there. I have a blog and we test various ketone supplements, ketogenic foods, I'm self-experimenting and have collected a lot of data
Starting point is 02:37:35
and we'll be putting some of that data in the blog. So I think that would be sort of like the one stop shop website for anyone interested in hearing more about what I talked about. I'd also like to mention that our lab in collaboration with Epigenics Foundation is sponsoring the Metabolic Health Summit that's occurring in January 30th to February 3rd in Long Beach, California,
Starting point is 02:38:01
and it's gonna have an amazing array of basic scientists, for example, like Luke Cantley, will be there, be a keynote speaker, Thomas Safrid, there's going to be clinicians there, influencers there, and a lot of entrepreneurial people will be there representing companies that are really changing the shape of this industry. So I'm very interested in technologies, and foods, and supplements that can make nutritional ketosis accessible for people that want to use it, not only therapeutically for metabolic management
Starting point is 02:38:36
of a disorder, but maybe also for prevention or longevity, or just as a lifestyle. So you're gonna find there's something for everybody at the metabolic health summit from basic science will be sort of what our lab is focused on. But from clinical application to moving the science into human applications is really the theme of that. And can people register for that already?
Starting point is 02:39:01
Yes, I think you can go to the website and register. If you want to be a sponsor, I think you can sort of download the sponsorship package. There's going to be a lot of high-profile representation there that would bring sort of more awareness and more reach to your product. If you have a product there, so we're looking for sponsors. And I think we've nailed down most of our speakers. But if you're interested in speaking too, it might be good to contact us through the website. Got it. And on Twitter, you're pretty active. What's your handle?
Starting point is 02:39:30
Yeah, before I realize how important it's to have a, like a handle that you can remember, it's Dominic Dagosti, too. We'll link to it. Yeah, we'll link to it. It's not the easiest to remember. And also Facebook, I'm fairly active. Dominic Dagosti, you know, one, I think that's my handle on Facebook too. So I kind of cross-post
Starting point is 02:39:49
on each and try to use Instagram a little bit more because they tell me I got to use it more, but not too active on that. All right. Well, let me make sure we link through all of those things. I want to thank you again. I owe a lot of what I know in this space to you. And I can say the same, thank you. Yeah, incredible. I try to blog. It's been a great resource for many. You are arguably one of the most generous people

I've ever met when it comes to his insights. Dom, I don't know that you get enough credit for, not only the work you've done, but for how much work you do behind the scenes as far as sharing your knowledge with people. I'll just share one very quick anecdote. Personally, one of my best friends from medical school, his wife has breast cancer. And, you know, without any hesitation, you were more than happy to speak with them about some of these things that they could do above
Starting point is 02:40:34
and beyond what she was already doing, which was participating in a clinical trial, where, by the way, she is the only woman to still be alive in this clinical trial. So the trial has closed that agent will likely not be approved, though she will have a compassionate exemption. But, you know, she is someone who has been on a ketogenic diet now for six years and has and remains incredibly indebted to the work that you've done. And her oncologist and Boston are sort of amazed that she's alive. Interestingly, next year, Lou Cantley will be explaining a very plausible mechanism for why she is still alive.
Starting point is 02:41:11
It's a paper that I'm sure you're aware of that was just approved and will be out in nature very soon. So anyway, I could sit here and spend another hour thanking you for everything, but I know nobody really wants to hear that, so I'll be quick about it and just tell you again that Dom, you're an amazing guy. You really are one of those people that I think fits in the category of just being kind of a treasure, and so on behalf of many people I want to thank you. And thank you, thank you for giving me this platform. I know your podcasts will be an
