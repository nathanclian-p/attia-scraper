Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia. This podcast, my website, and my weekly newsletter, I'll focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone. Our goal is to provide the best content and health and wellness. Full stop, and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen. If you enjoy this podcast, we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level. At the end of this episode, I'll explain what those benefits are, or if you want to learn

more now, head over to peteratia MD dot com forward slash subscribe. Now without further delay, here's today's episode. I guess this week is Michael Rintala. Michael is a chiropractor based out of San Diego, California, where he has a practice that focuses on rehabilitation, which is how I met him. In addition to his practice treating patients and training a wide variety of patients, he is also one of only 18 international instructors for the Prague School of Rehabilitation, teaching dynamic neuromuscular stabilization, also known as DNS. He serves as part of the PGA tour sports medicine team and the USA Surfing Performance Committee. This is an episode that's really dedicated
Starting point is 00:01:25
to understanding the Prague School of Rehabilitation and DNS or Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization, which many of you have probably heard me talk about in the past. It came up a little bit during the podcast with Beth Lewis, and it's come up on a few other podcasts. It also comes up from time to time in social media when I post videos of some of the movements that we do in our DNS training.
Starting point is 00:01:50
In this episode we get into the history of DNS, which is a relatively new discipline. It's really been around less than 20 years and how it grew out of the Prague School of Rehabilitation, who the effectively the founding fathers of that school of thinking were dating back to the 1950s, we then kind of get into how the development told milestones of an infant factor into or weigh into basically things that anyone listening to this should care about, which is how they move and how they function and how they avoid injury and maintain longevity. So this is a complicated episode in the sense that I have to be honest, I think some of the concepts here don't always lend themselves well to discussion. I think being able to watch this on video
Starting point is 00:02:32
gets a little bit easier because at least you can see some of the hand gestures. And of course this episode will be accompanied by a video where Michael, Beth, and I go through many of the foundational movements. Now, that video will be available only for the subscribers, but I certainly would encourage all subscribers or even non-subscribers to sign up to make sure that they see that because I think that's where a lot of the heavy lifting gets done. Ultimately, of course, DNS is something that needs to be felt
Starting point is 00:03:00
more than watched. So my real hope is that most people try to put some of this into practice and begin to experience it. So without further delay, please enjoy my conversation with Michael Rintala. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael.
Starting point is 00:03:16
I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael.
Starting point is 00:03:24
I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I'm Michael. I and Beth. Thanks for having me. Thank you. Been wanting to sit down for quite a while, and obviously the events of 2020 kind of got in the way of that, but maybe just start for folks by giving a little bit of your background. You grew up in Northern California, right? Yeah, grew up in Northern California, and eventually went to school down in San Diego at UC San Diego. What sports did you play growing up? My primary sport or the sport that I was most passionate about was tennis. And I interested in that from an early age. Played other sports, other organized sports,
Starting point is 00:04:00
but tennis was the one that I was drawn to and had the passion for. So early on specialized in that played lots of junior tennis tournaments trained a lot eventually played in college and that obsession or passion kind of drove me to the way that I practice today. I'm a chiropractor. I'm based out of San Diego, California, as you know. kind of drove me to the way that I practice today. I'm a chiropractor, I'm based out of San Diego, California, as you know, I specialize in rehabilitation, sports medicine.
Starting point is 00:04:33
I am also, so I have the private practice there. I'm fortunate enough to also be able to spend some time on the PGA tour and the World Surf League tour as part of their sports medicine crew or team, and also fortunate enough to be part of USA Surfing Performance Committee, helping with assessing and training the US athletes, the surfing athletes for the upcoming Olympics.
Starting point is 00:05:03
Cool. Today, obviously, the thing we want to talk about is this super deep dive into something called dynamic neuromuscular stabilization. Now, folks listening to this have probably heard me talk about this in the past. They follow me on social media. They'll notice from time to time I'm doing movements that probably look a little silly. Sometimes working with you or working with Beth or working with another colleague of ours, Michael strumsness is actually how we all met. But I think for the purpose of this discussion, let's assume a person has never heard of DNS, has never heard of the Prague school or any of these things. Can you in a somewhat succinct, but not terribly brief manner, explain
Starting point is 00:05:48
to people how all of this school of rehabilitation coalesced around this idea of what we call DNS. So going back to the founding fathers of the Prague school and what these various insights were that each of them had and how that sort of came together. DNS or dynamic neuromuscular stabilization kind of built on some pioneers of functional rehabilitation. There's many that have been part of the Prague School of Rehabilitation, but I think talking about the influence on the development of dynamic neuromuscular stabilization by Professor Powell Kohlage, who runs the rehabilitation department at Prague School at this time. I think we need to go back post-World War II, Cold War era 1950s is where Prague School of Rehabilitation was really founded.
Starting point is 00:06:50
And it was founded as part of the medical faculty of Charles University and Prague and the Czech Republic, or formerly Czechoslovakia, and now Czech Republic. And being post-World War II, Cold War era, so they were in Eastern Europe behind the wall. That may have been a factor for their, not reliance, but tendency towards the use of observation in both diagnosis, both observation and palpation for diagnosis and treatment. All three of these pioneers were neurologists. And who were the three? La Rmiganda, Carl Levitt and Balclaw Voita. Professor Yanda, he had a keen sense of observation and he
Starting point is 00:07:41
formulated concepts and principles that tied into postural habituation, specifically the tendency for specific musculature to tend towards tightness and other musculature to tend towards weakness. And he termed this uppercross and lower-cross syndrome. So, for example, with an upp an upper cross syndrome meaning the neck and shoulder region with demands of life and a tendency towards postural habituation such as with sustained seated postures. There's a tendency towards the muscles in the back of the neck, the occipital muscles, the sternocladiomastoid muscle, which is the muscle that also attaches to the skull and down to the sternoclubicular joint.
Starting point is 00:08:33
The peck muscles, the upper traps, that musculature would tend towards a tightening or overactivation. Other musculature in the upper extremity, the serratus, which attaches to the ribs and the back of the scapula, the deep neck flexors, the middle and lower traps would have a tendency to tend towards a weakness. And with that tendency towards overutilization or hypertenicity and underutilization in habition, weakness, that would also, he also recognized that that would affect the quality of movement throughout the kinematic chain and subsequently would lead to overload in specific areas throughout that kinematic chain. So that was a big contribution on his part. Where would those places of overload be? So if you
Starting point is 00:09:32
have this tightness in the muscles you've described, the weakness in the muscles you've described, what is the consequence of that? Where does that load get distributed? Right, so you with that imbalance and that tendency towards postural habituation, you would see a tendency to overload in the transitional areas throughout the spine and throughout the extremity. So, it didn't go into the specifics for lower cross syndrome, lower cross syndrome. You have a tendency for the flexor, hip flexor complex to be overactive, tightened. So the so-as, alias so-as, rectus femoris. The back extensor and
Starting point is 00:10:13
musculature will also tend towards tightness. And then the weakness or the inhibition will tend towards the lower abdominal region and the gluteal region. towards the lower abdominal region and the gluteal region. So looking at it globally, you would see a tendency to overload again throughout the extremities so that the hip joint, the knee joint, but also specifically dealing with the spine, the lumbar cycle region, thoracic lumbar region, and the cervical thoracic region. All the areas where you see the transition of the curvatures, Lordosis and chyphosis. And with that tendency for overload, you will get repetitive stresses on the passive structures within that kinematic chain. So as a clinician, we know that if you tend to image these areas, or if you image the spine,
Starting point is 00:11:10
these are the areas that tend to have the most degenerative changes, or the most disc pathology. And those changes aren't usually traumatic, they're not acute, they're accumulated over time. So, the observation of these postural patterns or postural syndromes, and then the recognition of the dysfunction with movement efficiency that it caused led him to develop specific treatments both exercise- wise and manual wise to address those issues. Yanda also had suffered polio. Is a youngster, didn't he? Yeah.
Starting point is 00:11:52
So, he had suffered the residual effects, the post polio type syndrome, and that was probably a motivation for his passion for rehabilitation, his passion for the observation of movement. His colleague, Karl Levit, also a neurologist, he shared that observation, palpation, tendency to utilize that for diagnosis and treatment. He specifically focused on joint dysfunction, soft tissue dysfunction as it related to those those upper and lower cross syndromes. So he developed specific mobilization techniques for both the joint and the soft tissues addressing what they were seeing with those postural habituation and movement dysfunction. The third pioneer, also a neurologist, but also a pediatric neurologist with Volklav Voita, his observations observing the ontogenesis or the development of motor function after
Starting point is 00:13:00
birth during the first 12 months where the Postural Foundations are established neurologically. He developed specific tests called Postural Reactions where he could tell the quality or the health of the maturation of the central nervous system during that period of time. And by doing this, he could assess whether there was pathology or a healthy developing central nervous system. So he developed seven specific postural reaction tests, developed and modified some other ones, utilized primitive reflexes, and just observation, observation of the infant during development to be able to recognize the biological age, meaning the maturation
Starting point is 00:13:54
of that central nervous system as compared to the chronological age. So for example, if you had a six month old infant that was moving and reacting like a six-week-old infant, that would be an indication that there was some central nervous system pathology. His focus was on treatment of the cerebral palsy infant and patient, and he was able to utilize that observation, those observation of the post posture reactions, the assessment of the primitive reflexes, to recognize early on before it would manifest clinically, so that interventions could be taken earlier on to take advantage of the neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to form motor angrams more efficiently, and work around those central lesions that you see with cerebral palsy.
Starting point is 00:14:54
So, all three of these founding members or founders of prog school of rehabilitation founders of ProgSchool of Rehabilitation were Professor Kolaj's colleagues, mentors, instructors, they shared patients, they discussed cases, and Pavel Kolaj developed or evolved all that knowledge and experience into what we call dynamic neuromuscular stabilization today. Before, Pavl came along, so fast forward, this started in the 50s, but fast forward to the 90s. So the Prague School is well established. You have these sort of founding fathers, so to speak. What were the applications of the Prague school at that time? How much of it was rehabilitation for kids with cerebral palsy or rehabilitation for people who were injured versus prehabilitation for athletes?
Starting point is 00:15:58
Like, what was the breadth of the applicability of prox school. Prox school, it's a group of clinicians. And more of the early 90s, the application was primary rehabilitation, cerebral palsy, general population, with Pavel, Professor Kolas, just to go in a little bit of his background. Again, he's the head of Proxical Rehabilitation. He's also had clinician for the check Olympic teams and check national sports teams, hockey, soccer,
Starting point is 00:16:34
men's and women's tennis. He himself was a high level, Olympic level gymnast. So he's a pediatric physiotherapist as well. His work with those three pioneers, his experience as an athlete, his experience treating, cerebral palsy and infants, he took that or started to apply that base of knowledge to the athletic population.
Starting point is 00:17:05
And the focus of, in the thinking of these founders of prox school and prox school today is the influence of the central nervous system is huge and kind of king as far as facilitating the efficiency of transfer of load throughout that kinematic chain. So early on the focus was more rehabilitation over multiple populations, but maybe late 90s, early 2000s, Pobble started to apply those teachings to that athletic population, meaning to an un-injured athletic population or to an injured athletic population.
Starting point is 00:17:54
Probably at that time more of an injured population, to stand out athletes that he was able to work with and integrate his concepts and principles of dynamic stability were Jean-Lezzny. I'll say that right. He was a Olympic javelin thrower, three-time gold medal winner still holds the record for Javelin 98.48 meters I believe and the other one is Yamir Yager, hockey player, Czech hockey player. He was able to help and work with them, help them rehabilitate from injuries, but then also integrate the concepts and principles of dynamic neuromusculosstabilization to one, decrease the risk of re-injury,
Starting point is 00:18:53
but two, also provide the potential for better performance. And we can talk about specifics of those concepts and principles. Yeah, so we're into the early 2000s where now, Pobbles basically taking some of the fundamental principles from the Prague School and creating this new discipline, let's use each of the words to explain to people what this is.
Starting point is 00:19:18
So dynamic, of course, is movement, right? It's not just static, it applies to in motion. Neuromuscular, I think, explains the connection between the nervous system, both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, but really, as you said, an emphasis on the central nervous system and how that connects to the muscular system. So a lot of people, I think, assume that acts of strength are purely muscular and they don't realize the neurologic control of those things. For me personally, the hardest one to explain to an unsuspecting audience is stabilization. Now, I have a way that I
Starting point is 00:19:57
like to explain it, but I want to hear you go first. Okay. It's important to talk about the utilization of developmental kinesiology as a way to explain posture and explain dynamic stabilization. When we're first born, functionally and structurally, we are immature. So our central nervous system is still maturing. Our bones are still forming. The first weeks of life, first four to six weeks of life, the lower central nervous system structure is the brain stem levels kind of dominant. So primitive reflexes are dominant. Examples of that suck reflexes, gasping, grasping, grasping, obviously being able to blink.
Starting point is 00:20:48
I mean, the most primitive reflexes that are species, I mean, we take these for granted. So they help keep us alive during that period of time. So as that central nervous system matures, and if it's maturing in a healthy way, by a three month period of time, actually, let me go back, usually starting maybe eight weeks, we start to facilitate the synergy, coordination, and timing of the deep stabilizing group of musculature. And that's diaphragm pelvic floor, the entire dom and wall, the inter segmental spinal musculature that runs throughout the entire spine.
Starting point is 00:21:28
All right. I'm going to stop you right here. We are going to talk about these things so much that I want to make sure people understand them. So let's go back to the first one. Everybody's heard of their diaphragm, but let's put some actual metrics to it. It's a dome-shaped muscle. It's a striated muscle, but it has kind of a non-muscular part as well. But I think what most people don't appreciate is how big it is, right? And how I can't even remember, it's been, you know, back when I was in school, I had to know every attachment of it. You recall how far it attaches down and up on both the ribs and the vertebral bodies? Yeah. So, the diaphragm, just think of it like a big periscuter, big sheath of muscle that separates
Starting point is 00:22:12
the abdominal cavity from the heart and lungs. The attachments, it has attachments on the lower six ribs on the back of the zyfoid process, which is a little bone at the end of the sternum, and then also attachments on L1, L2 vertebra. So that's about around the thoracic lumbar junction. So that's just an enormous expanse of attachment. Attachments being where the muscles attach and anchor, and therefore that gives you a sense
Starting point is 00:22:44
of what their lever capacity is, what they can actually contract. Right. So that there's those attachments, and then there's a central tendon that when the diaphragm activates, so one of the primary functions is respiration. So I go to take a breath in,
Starting point is 00:23:03
that diaphragm activates, descends, the central tendon drops, the lungs expand, that change in pressure. You're able to draw air into the lungs, and then there's a recoil of diaphragm and the air comes out. So there's a primary respiratory function. During the first weeks of development or ontogenesis, which is the study of motor development after birth, it's primary respiratory function. The central nervous system has not matured to the point to create the synergy within the other deep stabilizing group of musculature to create that fixed point through the trunk and the pelvis. So by around three months period of time, that central nervous system has matured to the
Starting point is 00:23:52
point where now the hardwired genetic ingrained motor programs start to manifest themselves. So we start to see this coordinated activity of that deep group of musculature. So we've now, I mean, for me and I think for many people, a very helpful image is that of a cylinder. The strongest possible cylinder, right, would have a big top, a big bottom, and a beautifully symmetric side compartment to it, right? A lousy cylinder would have a tiny little bottom, a big top and a dented middle. So if a diaphragm formulates the top of that cylinder, what makes up the bottom of that cylinder?
Starting point is 00:24:38
The bottom of the cylinder, we're looking at the pelvic floor, which is an area of musculature, basically where the babies come out. And that musculature will coordinate the regulation or management of intradomal pressure that is created with the dissonion of the diaphragm. So the diaphragm, three main functions, respiration, but there's also, obviously, this huge postural function where it descends even more and creates an intrabdomal pressure so that when that pressure is created, the pelvic floor will ecentrically load, meaning the musculature is active, but stretches, you can think of it like wind blowing into a sail, where the wind blows into the sail,
Starting point is 00:25:33
it opens and activates, and then it holds and maintains the pressure. But then at the same time, we have the entire domino wall, which consists of the rectus muscles, our six pack muscles, our oblique musculature, which is musculature that crosses the body, comes up and has attachments under the thoracic cage, the ribcage, and then a big one called transverse abdominis, which wraps around from the back, the thraccal number, or fascia around to the front.
Starting point is 00:26:07
So as that diaphragm descends to facilitate a stabilizing function, that intradull pressure is created, that musculature reacts to the pressure. There's an eccentric load and then an isometric. And then as we coordinate, to the pressure, there's an eccentric load and then an isometric. And then as we coordinate, so we have respiratory function, postural function, but we have to now coordinate between both respiratory and postural functions. So our central nervous system, our brain needs to manage that pressure to provide enough stability, but also allow the diaphragm to also allow the lungs to expand.
Starting point is 00:26:52
This coordination is usually where we see people kind of falling apart. And if they fall apart, they'll tend towards what Yanda saw, which is that overutilization. So in the lower cross syndrome of the extensor musculature and the flexor musculature, because we lose that synergy of that deep stabilization. And if we lose that synergy and that ability to create that fixed point, then our brains do their jobs,
Starting point is 00:27:22
which is to find a way to still move and do tasks that we need to do. But in doing so, we'll go to more of a high threshold, like I describe more of a compensatory pattern. So, developmentally, that three-month period of time is where we ideally will have that synergy coordination and timing of that deep group of musculature that will allow the infant to create a fixed point through the trunk and the pelvis. And then also with that management of that intradual pressure, there's
Starting point is 00:27:59
a loading on the front of the spine. And with that loading, we get an uprighting effect throughout the spine. So then the inter segmental spinal musculature are eccendrically loading and managing that pressure against the spine to help with that uprighting effect and that unloading effect. Let's again make sure people know exactly what we mean
Starting point is 00:28:24
because we're gonna use the terms a lot. When you talk about eccentrically versus concentrically loading, to me the easiest way to define is just using the definitions, so a muscle is concentrically loaded when it's getting shorter as it's being loaded, eccentrically is getting longer as it's being loaded. So for example, a bicep curl, this is the concentric phase of loading.
Starting point is 00:28:45
This is the eccentric phase of loading. What a lot of people take for granted is both of those are important. But most people, when training tend to emphasize the concentric and don't realize the eccentric, I heard a great story. I think it was actually from Michael Straumsness that when a group of US weight lifters visited a group of Eastern European weightlifters, I don't know maybe it was even you that told this story, they realized that they were counting reps differently. So the American lifters would consider a rep one is up and down. So they were putting all the effort into the concentric, but then more or less
Starting point is 00:29:20
dropping the weight on the way down, not really focusing on the effort to put the weight down. And the Eastern European lifters were doing the opposite, they were counting it as two reps. It's up, one, down, two. So it was just as much effort into that eccentric. And it's not to say one is right or wrong, because they serve different purposes. Obviously, more emphasis on the eccentric will create more hypertrophy.
Starting point is 00:29:48
So there are times that you want both. But again, when you look at, for example, and we'll get to this, I'm sure, but when you look at hip abduction, the importance of being able to eccentricly control that is such an important part of injury prevention. And you can spend all the time in the world working on concentrically doing that. So later today, when we actually do some stuff on the mat, you'll have some exercises to demonstrate that. Yeah.
Starting point is 00:30:12
The observation, having knowledge of the developmental kinesiology or the ontogenesis and watching that maturation of the central nervous system. And with that healthy maturation, seeing the synergy of the deep stabilization, providing that fixed point, and then allowing efficient transfer of force and load throughout that trunk and pelvis area, what these pioneers, Votta, Yanda, Levitt, Colage noticed
Starting point is 00:30:51
was the importance of the quality, basically training that central nervous system, because if you can facilitate that ideal stabilization, stereotype and synergy, then you provide what Professor Kohlogs calls Centration throughout that chain of movement, throughout that kinematic chain. And what he describes Centration as is, for example, let's say you have the hip joint, is the ability to maintain an ideal position of the femur and the acetabulum, which is a hip joint, throughout that full range of motion.
Starting point is 00:31:31
In order to do that, you need a synergier, nice interplay between agonist and antagonist, like you describe the biceps curl. So an interplay between concentric, eccentric activity of the opposing musculature around the joint to help maintain that position. And if that is compromised throughout any part of that kinematic chain, it's going to affect the quality of centration or transfer of force and load above and below that region. So the quality of that synergy coordination timing of that deep stabilization is what Prague School is focusing on with assessment and with their treatment methods. And this is
Starting point is 00:32:22
based out of that observation of developmental kinesiology, which is the neurophysiological aspects of the maturing locomotor system. They utilize that as their definition of dynamic movement, dynamic posture, ideal posture. Let's go back to the three-month- old infant and start talking about what normal developmental milestones are through the lens of DNS picking it up at three months. So what is a three month old infant starting to demonstrate and how is that progressing as they become six months, nine months a year, et cetera? Right.
Starting point is 00:32:59
At three months with that ability to create that fixed point. Now the larger longer musculature and larger muscle groups have something to anchor off of. So creating that fixed point, for example, allows the infant to now turn their head and fix their gaze. Prior to that, during those first weeks of life, there's the ability to fix their gaze is not there. By three months providing that stable point, now they can turn fix their gaze. Now they start to get more of the sematicentary input from the environment, which is going to trigger
Starting point is 00:33:41
an external cue or a drive to start to explore. The infant at that period of time can lift their legs out of the base of support so they can you'll see a triple flexion, so 90 degrees at the hip, 90 degrees at the knee, neutral position of the ankle joint or sub-taller joint. They'll be able to bring their hands together and bring their hands to their mouth. And let's explain what's actually required to do that, because again, most adults would take that for granted. But what is it neuromuscularly that is being hardwired in that three-month-old infant that
Starting point is 00:34:17
is pretty impressive, and when you really stop to think about it, that they're able to bring both legs up, coordinate that movement. And by the way, are they necessarily doing that the way a 50 year old person would do that if you laid them on their back? Like I, having now watched a lot of infants, they tend to all kind of do it in a very similar way, whereas adults tend to not do it in a certain way. Neurologically, the coordination and timing of that deep stabilization group of musculature
Starting point is 00:34:52
needs to be on point to be able to create a fixed point so that, again, the larger muscle groups can anchor off that to bring the legs up. Now the infant has, you know, there's a different thoracic cage size at that point. Their head in relation to their body is bigger, their limb length is bigger. They're still growing. The bones are still forming. So, that's much different than a 50-year-old. Our limb proportions are different, our mobility is going to be different. So we may have different body proportions, mobility, but we all went through these developmental milestones and most of us develop our central nervous system in a healthy way.
Starting point is 00:35:43
So we still have those same motor patterns that our central nervous system is going to want to kick into. Some of the efficiency of accessing those nice stereotypical motor patterns that we're born with can be compromised due to soft tissue, dysfunction, rigidity, lack of range of motion throughout our joints, postural habituation that Yonda described, all that factors into our can override the access to those ideal patterns. What Prague School tries to do is,
Starting point is 00:36:28
with the specific assessments, assess that efficiency of that deep stabilization system, whatever age that we're at, and then utilize specific, what we call active exercises, which are based off of the developmental milestones, which we'll get back to in a second, to utilize specific points of support and positioning to help wake up or facilitate those patterns that we still have as adults.
Starting point is 00:36:57
So three months of age is the start of that ability to create a sagittal stabilization. Tell people what sagittal means versus coronal. So, sagittal is kind of like straight ahead. Frontal plane would be if you're on your side or to the side. And then there's transverse plane, which is, think about rotating in the transverse plane. So, what happens now is the approach six months of age. Three months, you see the start. Four months, that coordination is usually complete.
Starting point is 00:37:33
Four or four and a half months. Once they've completed that ideal facilitation of a fixed point, now they start to be able to utilize the oblique slings, and you'll start to see some differentiation in the pelvis and in the limbs. And as that synergy gets more and more efficient, which means better, better management of that inch of dull pressure, you'll see the hips coming up into higher position. The legs coming up into being able to come up into a higher position. The infants range of reach will improve as well. At four months, they're able to touch the groin area.
Starting point is 00:38:14
At five months, they can reach their knees. At six months, they can reach their feet. And then by seven months, they're bringing the foot to the mouth. And just to be clear, most people would say, is that just a result of increasing flexibility? But really the answer is not so much that they have more flexibility. They are quite flexible at birth. It's more that they now have the motor control and the stability to coordinate something that is everywhere from shoulder to foot or
Starting point is 00:38:46
hand to foot basically. Right. And do it in an efficient manner. So I'm a parent, you're a parent, and you remember when the kids were developing, they get this all the time. They're like, oh, my son was rolling all the way over at three months. That is possible. They can normally, well, not normally, but ideally at that six month period of time, there's enough of that synergy and coordination and timing that the infant, you'll see the infant at that time rolling on to its stomach. Now, they could maybe do it at three months, but they're not going to do it with that coordination and that efficiency of transfer of force and load. You may see them turn and kind of revert back to more of that the newborn posture, meaning they're finding a way to turn. They're using more of a compensatory pattern to make that action happen.
Starting point is 00:39:45
Kind of the same thing, you see with movement, with adults, if the synergy coordination, timing of deep stabilization is not on point, they find a way to move. But when they move, as with the first weeks of life, the newborn infant, you'll see anterior pelvic tilt, you see a flaring of the ribcage, the shoulders, you'll see elevation, protection, reclination, or extension through the cervical spine. The newborn, when they look or when they move, the whole body is moving. They don't have that ability to create that fixed point, but they're still able to make movements.
Starting point is 00:40:32
As they're going through the developmental milestones with that motivation or that drive to move and explore their environment, they may find ways to reach that toy, but not be creating the ideal centration and stabilization. With the central nervous system maturation, it's not like at three months, four months, six months, boom, they wake up and automatically are there in this perfect synergy coordination timing.
Starting point is 00:41:05
As that central nervous system is maturing, there's thousands of trials and errors. They're forming the brain mapping and motor angrails, finding the right points of support as the coordination of the central nervous system is kicking in. So you may see at the beginning of six months and they're turning, maybe they're not able to keep the alignment of the diaphragms during the turning, but they're still able to do it. Maybe by then three weeks into it, now their coordination and timing has become more efficient and better, and they're able to make that turn with a better quality of activation.
Starting point is 00:41:49
So, how does it go from there? What gets them to crawling and ultimately standing? So what you see with the developmental milestones at three months, we talked about with the newborn, you have more of the lower central nervous system structures are maturing. At three months, we see more maturation in the sub-cortical region of the central nervous system, and that's where we get the manifestation of these postural foundations. So as that central nervous system matures, certain milestones, three months, four months, five, six, seven, you'll see the
Starting point is 00:42:26
infant starting to be able to attain higher, more unstable positions. These developmental milestones are moving towards basically the verticalization process going from either soupine on the back or prone and then working their way up trial and error, learning with that healthy central nervous system maturation, where at seven months they're able to come to their side, eight months they come up into what we call a high oblique sit position. Nine months they're able to crawl, 10, 11 months. You'll see them being able to attain like a kneeling position. 12 months, they're squatting. 13, 14 months, they're standing, and then 14, 16 months, on average, you see the start of of
Starting point is 00:43:18
ambulation. Now this is variable. Some kids, my son was walking at 10 months. There's maybe 15 months, 16 months. So there's variability within these milestones of where we see the infants, but on average, these specific points, you'll see a specific competency in stability and reaching or moving towards that verticalization process. Now, if you exclude cases of pathology like CP and things like that where there are injuries that are preventing the neuromuscular development and the achievement of these milestones, is it more or less the case that all kids who are given the fair chance to sort of explore and go about these things naturally will reach a certain age, call it two or three, and they'll be quite healthy from a dynamic and movement standpoint?
Starting point is 00:44:18
Like is it, you know, for example, like yesterday we spent a bunch of time looking at my three and a half year old, and frankly it's a clinic and movement at that age, right? Is it safe to assume basically all three year olds move really, really well? Like they haven't started to get into the habituated movement patterns that will begin to destroy them, right? Yeah. VOTA and others talk about what they see is around 70% of infants are going to have that healthy central nervous system maturation, go through the first weeks of life, the postural
Starting point is 00:44:58
foundations, the three to 12 months, the subcortical, and then from two, four, six, six years of age, you have more of the cortical maturation, where you see fine motor dexterity and movement, you know, ability to write. And you see the language develop and you see motor learning. Sorry, the subcortical phase goes till about two. Three to 12 months is where we see these the postural foundations. After that, you start to get that cortical integration maturation, but the motor learning and the process, it's like two to six, but I mean, and beyond. Now, I'm surprised to hear you say only 70%. Right.
Starting point is 00:45:50
This is, I don't know if I can't say the study, maybe it's their observation. So they talk about 70% normal maturation. The other 30%, it's a spectrum. So you'll have on one end the CP child or the CNS pathology, but then there's this spectrum on the other end of the spectrum. Yanda called it minimal brain dysfunction. It's also called central coordination disorder. So there's maybe not that ideal development, but again, there's a spectrum to that. So that may manifest during that, when we see the cortical time of central nervous system maturation, maybe there is learning disabilities or not as efficient movement patterns.
Starting point is 00:46:48
And this is something that prog school, as far as a curriculum, there's a whole pediatrics section with their curriculum, which they go deeper into that aspect of observation and specific utilization of treatment options. Usually with a healthy central nervous system maturation and a good environment for the child to explore movement and the variability of movement and do the trial and error and find their ideal points of support. You're going to see this nice healthy maturation, things that may compromise that. I mean, we see in modern society and culture, a kid who's in their car seat six hours a day or maybe doesn't have that environment where they can explore.
Starting point is 00:47:46
I think another one that I remember Michael showing with me was when kids are sped up on milestones. So for example, those seats that prematurely prop kids into a seated position. Shambies. Yeah. Well, even for me. Yeah. You know, that little bobby chair. Yeah. We're, and again, we're all guilty of this. We stuck our, I know we stuck our kids in these things, at least the first two. Because when our third kid came along, I was already interested in DNS.
Starting point is 00:48:10
So then he became sort of the observation for DNS. But with our first two, yeah, you're gonna stick them in those silly seated chairs. And they don't have the support before they're ready. So they can't even support their own weight. So they're in this slouch position. And then you put them in those things. We called it the circle of neglect. So it's like the thing where, you know, they're standing before they should be standing. So all of these things actually interfere with the normal neuromuscular development.
Starting point is 00:48:39
Putting kids in shoes too early probably does a tremendous disservice to them. Right. So ideally they're gonna have an environment where they're gonna figure this out themselves versus another one is the little walkers that they'll hold onto and walk. Ideally, they're going to play with their environment and with that combination of healthy central nervous system
Starting point is 00:49:07
maturation, find those ideal points of support and be able to utilize those motor patterns that are manifested with that healthy central nervous system. So the environment that we have children in is key. And this, I mean, you can take this and look at just our society, just with as adults. Let's go from, okay, so we can put them in shoes too early, put them in silly set up seats in the circle of neglect and give them walkers.
Starting point is 00:49:43
And then another huge set of insults come when they go to school, right? Because now they're sitting in chairs for six or seven hours a day. And what does that do for a six or seven year old, which is unfortunately, by the time they're six, they're sort of sitting in chairs six hours a day at least. So what is that doing to interfere with this process? This is where you start to see the start of those postural syndromes. When we get into those sustained seated postures, one of the main things that happens during those developmental milestones with healthy central nervous system maturation is we're
Starting point is 00:50:20
able to lie and keep alignment or approximation of the pelvic floor in the thoracic diaphragm. The more efficiently we do that, the more efficiently we manage intradual pressure and upright throughout the spine and then again transfer a force and load. If we fall into repetitive postures or postural habituation, which as a society is kind of a bit prevalent, gravity is going to win. No matter how nice the chair is, we're going to start to fall into that slumping posture. And when we get into that slumping posture, the shoulder is coming forward, that is actually going to create an inhibition of the diaphragm's ability to descend. And again, we need that descending of the healthy and ideal descending of the diaphragm
Starting point is 00:51:13
for both respiration and stabilization. So if we start getting that descending becomes inhibited due to the postural abituation, our brain is going to find a way to get air to the lungs. So it'll start to kick in the accessory breathing musculature, which is that the sternoclidomastoid, the upper traps, muscles called the scalines, which attached here, cervical spine and the upper two ribs, you'll see the peck minor also start to help to lift the thoracic cage to help get the expansion to get the air. So again, the brain just starts to do its job, which we need air.
Starting point is 00:52:00
We're going to use these guys to get the air. And it's a good short-term kind of survival strategy, but if we do it often enough, that becomes the go-to pattern. So you'll see a change in respiratory pattern, meaning decrease utilization of full expansion of the diaphragm and more of a pattern of overutilizing the accessory breathing musculature. This can occur quite young.
Starting point is 00:52:27
I think when we were joking about it yesterday, but you look at my youngest, I mean, his abdomen is huge. That's obviously an enormous asset to him. You can see it when he breathes. It's abdominal expansion more than it is, thoracic expansion. At child that age, if developing normally is not using any of these accessory respiratory muscles. And there's something about this anchor point being in the abdomen, right?
Starting point is 00:52:55
I mean, one of the first things I learned in DNS was how to regain intra-addominal pressure through eccentric loading of that cylinder. I don't think it had ever been presented to me how important that was because prior to that any amount of perceived intra-abdominal pressure had been acquired through concentric loading. So for example, when trying to pick up something heavy, you can take two strategies to that. I think most people would agree, if you wanted to pick up 300 pounds right now, you must generate pressure in the abdomen. I don't think anybody would assume that you could pick up 300 pounds, which is twice
Starting point is 00:53:38
your body weight, without generating pressure here. But how you do it matters. So explain those differences, and again, either with or without the developmental lens, but I think that the developmental lens is always a great way to think about how kids move. Right. So if you think about developmentally
Starting point is 00:53:59
and how that stabilizing stereotype evolves, think of it as an inside out strategy. You're creating an intrevalent pressure to load the abdominal wall, and then with the loading of the abdominal wall, eccentric, isometric, and then there's this interplay of all that activity, concentric, eccentric, isometric,
Starting point is 00:54:23
to manage that pressure for whatever tasks that you need to do. So if I'm sitting here and I'm going to pick up that pen, I need some function of stabilization to then move this limb, provide a fixed point for my anterior posterior slings to provide a nice position for the shoulder girdle to then again get that synergy throughout the kinematic chain and pick up the pen. So there's a certain amount of management of that intramdall pressure that I need. If I go to the chairs that we're sitting in that we moved earlier, this is a lot more weight. I'm going to need a lot more coordination and management and creation of intradual pressure to create the fixed point to transfer the ground reactive forces through my lower extremities, through my trunk and pelvis to, you know,
Starting point is 00:55:19
my arms holding the chair. So there's more facilitation of that intradone pressure. So that's what we see developmentally, that quality of stabilization. And that stabilization, it's not static, it's dynamic. We should be able to manage that intradone pressure through full extension, full rotation, full flexion. That's the beauty of that dynamic neuromuscular stability. And that's what we see with that quality we see in the high level athletes. We can also create stability by bracing. And if you think about bracing, if someone's going to punch me in the stomach, I may go for a concentric. And where the dominole of short me in the stomach, I may go for a concentric and where
Starting point is 00:56:06
the the domino wall shortens and tightens. I'm still creating a stabilizing function. And I can still use that to move objects or prepare for for impact when it comes to dynamic movement. for impact when it comes to dynamic movement, the inside out strategy and the central nervous system management of that stabilization allows me to create the stability efficiently where I need it, but then also be able to, for example, relax my extremity. So with high level movers, athletes, you see they'll have nice postural foundations. They also have very nice cortical function or body awareness. So the fetters, the kelly slaters and surfing, they have that ability to, their movement looks fluid and effortless. So they have that ability to relax and efficiently stabilize where they need to stabilize. Sometimes you need to incorporate that
Starting point is 00:57:14
bracing strategy on top of the facilitation of intradual pressure for excessive loads where we go beyond our threshold, our functional threshold, meaning our ability to keep that quality of stabilization. When we go beyond that ability, we go into what we call the functional gap. And when we go into the functional gap, that's where we see more of that high threshold strategy, maybe bracing
Starting point is 00:57:45
strategy to get the job done, to get that weight up, to maybe kick that ball a little extra harder. Training wise and athletics, that's where those athletes spend a lot of time, because they're always kind of pushing that threshold all the time. So you'll see with athletes a tendency, if they're spending all their time training, competing in that functional gap, beyond the ability to maintain the more efficient transfer of force and load, then that pattern, that high threshold compensatory pattern becomes the, starts to become the norm with everything, picking up the pencil. So one of the things that we try to do, or I try to do as far as with training and in
Starting point is 00:58:38
rehabilitation, not just with the athletes, but with, you know, the general population, is help them facilitate that quality of stabilization so they can increase that threshold of being able to stay within that functional threshold or that functional capacity so that when they do have to go into the functional gap and go to those compensatory patterns, it's not all the time. Let's talk about an elite athlete. And again, I think the thing with the most elite is they don't have to train in DNS. A lot of them are just doing this naturally. I mean, that's sort of what makes Roger Federer great.
Starting point is 00:59:16
And one of the hallmarks of that greatness is injury prevention. It's not just the greatness at what they do. It's the longevity with which they can do it. Yes. So when I lecture, I use Federer as an example. You know, you look at his career, just longevity and injury-wise. When he has been injured,
Starting point is 00:59:37
but usually you see a quick recovery. Going back to Yager and Gillesney, Gillesney had a 20-year career in Javlin, which I don't think is very common. Yager is 48. He's still playing. With Yager and Gillesney, Pablo working with them, the emphasis was on the awareness, the facilitation of this ideal stabilizing pattern, the timing of movement, the
Starting point is 01:00:07
centration throughout the kinematic chain. And then with that, the ability to, we call differentiate within, for example, the pelvis over that, that femoral head. So the focus was, with them was the quality over quantity, I guess you can say. What percentage of his time do you think, because obviously, Federer has just an unbelievable functional capacity, how often do you think he is in excess of that in that gap zone where he is using compensatory movements
Starting point is 01:00:38
that are putting long-term stability at risk? So I think when you see those athletes that rise to the top, you watch like Federer for example, you see the creating the point of support, the positioning, the alignment of everything. He's creating naturally that centration and that transfer of force and load. There is times, maybe he gets out of position or a little extra hardware, he's going to go into that functional gap. He naturally has a functional, huge functional capacity where he can maintain that. I think with him, you also, and this goes to training, he has a good team.
Starting point is 01:01:18
He has trainers that are programming certain things in a way and giving him certain things so that he can still facilitate that quality of movement and build strength capacity on top of that. One thing that I see, for example, out on the PGA tour, I'll see players that have good programs, good coaching, they'll tend to stay within that functional capacity. They're still pushing it and still, you know, with them it's just repetitive motion, which, postural habituation, repetitive motion, injury are things that compromise that synergy and coordination of that dynamic stability. So if you have good programming, dosing, loading, timing, recovery, and on top of that, you have
Starting point is 01:02:15
amazing, you know, body awareness and cortical function. You're going to see longevity and you're going to see nice quality of movement. What I see on the other end is players, athletes, poor training programs, overtraining, spending too much time in the functional gap falling into what my colleague Rich Olm talks about, the extensor compression syndrome, which you see a lot with lifting with the power athletes, which he works with a lot of. Then you see, when you have that reliance on that higher threshold, you see more incidents of injury, longer recovery, verse, the opposite, the fetters. Yeah, they get injured, but they recover fairly quickly. And that's what you see, again, Yager and Juleszny are nice examples of that. Both checks and Pavel working with them over this 20 year period of time, integrating and putting in his ideas
Starting point is 01:03:26
and his experience with everything that we talked about with those rehabilitation pioneers into these athletes, kind of like a little test subject, so to speak. So now, Prague School and DNS practitioners, that's what we're trying to help integrate with our athletes with the general population. What percentage of people that you work with are coming with an injury and therefore a need of rehabilitation where you're now applying DNS to presumably go back to, hey, this is
Starting point is 01:04:02
where the breakdown was. Let's go back to where that breakdown would have occurred developmentallyably go back to hey, this is where the breakdown was Let's go back to where that break down would have occurred Developmentally and go back and rebuild those steps. So we're gonna you're gonna learn how to stabilize your neck or stabilize your head using The stabilizing muscles appropriately. You're gonna learn how to generate concentric Intradominal pressure and you're gonna learn how to centrate Ipsilaterally and contralaterally, and all of these things. And then what percentage of your patients are not coming with an injury, but are coming for performance enhancement, and saying, you know, I just can't throw this
Starting point is 01:04:36
fastball any faster than 89 miles per hour. And the only way I'm going to get that faster is if I can create a better whip between my right hand and my left leg and hip. So those are two ends of the spectrum and how do you spend your time on those? Majority of people are coming to me because pain and injury, what happens, especially with the athletes, once we address that, once we calm down, whether it's if it's acute or chronic injury, we decrease pain and utilize the, there's different manual methods within DNS and then integrating the exercises that are based off
Starting point is 01:05:20
of those developmental milestones. Once they get to a certain point, ideally I'm going to work with the trainer or with the coach and hopefully they're on the same mindset so that they can then progress to the strength training, to the specific technique. More and more, these athletes are, you know, it's a combination of once they're out of pain, we work with the quality of stabilization and movement and transfer of force and load. Let's take a group of, let's say,
Starting point is 01:05:59
a hundred athletes who come to you in pain. Again, just looking for rough numbers. What percentage of them will buy into the thesis of this very non-traditional way of rehabilitating is going to help. What percentage of that of that hundred will stay with the program to get better? Not enough. So what's the number? 10, 20 percent, maybe. That's it. Yeah. When I see happening, you know, for example, Major League Baseball is integrating DNS more and more. So in San Diego, with the Padres, I started to consult with them a bit.
Starting point is 01:06:38
There's a hitting coach for the Dodgers that comes in and we kind of workshop ideas where he's integrating the DNS concepts and principles. So it's starting to get recognized more for that value as far as the performance enhancement aspects of it. Culturally within sport, what I see, especially in the West, they want numbers, they want what's their lift, what's their strength capacity, which is important, but I think it's also important to, again, integrate those to the quality of movement and stability and then increasing that their strength thresholds. But even just within injury,
Starting point is 01:07:27
so if you just, let's just say a hundred athletes that are, you know, let's say gymnasts and hockey players and football players that come in with lower back pain, you're saying only 20 of those would stick with the program until they got better. 80 of them would abandon the program before they improved. A lot of times in just across the patient population, a lot of times when once people are out of
Starting point is 01:07:49
pain, it's kind of out of sight, out of mind. They go back, they go back into their, their patterns. That's what I'm trying to differentiate, which is how many of them just stick with it along enough to get out of pain. The next question I'm going to ask is once out of pain, how many of them stick with the program and switch basically from rehab to pre-hab? Going back to that, one of my goals, especially with the athlete, once they're out of pain, we develop a pre-habilitation kind of program.
Starting point is 01:08:21
We utilize those, again, going back to the knowledge of developmental kinesiology and developmental milestones, which later will actually go through. So based on what I'm seeing with their insufficiency, and with the insufficiency of that coordination of stabilization, I will give them certain things, certain sequences of movements and exercises that they practice with awareness to facilitate better strategy for stability. And then that's part of their movement preparation or pre-habilitationitation before whether it's their strength training or their technique training or going out and and performing. That's a larger percentage because that's part of what I kind of program into the rehabilitation. So some athletes
Starting point is 01:09:22
will get that and they're okay great. This is good. I'm gonna go do it and then occasionally they're coming back and getting Maybe we're adding to it based on what how they're functioning now other athletes they want more and that's that smaller percentage part of it to probably access you know, availability, as far as being able to be in San Diego and working one-on-one with me. So there's different factors that will tie into how much they're doing. But within the whole treatment protocol, rehabilitation protocol, I'm giving them things that they should then integrate into their programs.
Starting point is 01:10:10
This is the most common chief complaint of a person that walks into your office. Is it lower back pain? That would be my guess. Yeah, majority is low back. Okay, so what are the most common causes of lower back pain that you see across the board, if they're suffering from low back pain, whether it's acute or chronic, usually there's an underlying pattern of that lack of or the inefficient activation of the deep stabilizing system, and more of a tendency towards that extension compression activation, that over activation of flexor extensor. Explain what that means in a bit more detail, given the ubiquity of this injury and the probability that 80% of the people listening to this have already experienced back pain or will experience back pain in their lives.
Starting point is 01:11:09
I wanna make sure if people take nothing away from this podcast, they understand the etiology of lower back pain. Unless you've had a car accident or a fall, that's like an acute injury, that can be a cause of low back pain. The majority that I see, it's more of a chronic overload over time, that if we have that strategy of too much flexure, extensure activity, which compromises the positioning of the intersacemental joints and transfer of force and load,
Starting point is 01:11:49
then with the compensatory pattern, we'll see more of a hinging in through that lumbar cycle region. And with that hinging, over time, it's like if you keep bending a spoon, it's going to break you weaken the structure. But yeah, let's talk about the actual anatomy and I yesterday I said I wished I'd brought a skeleton so the sacrum is basically a single bone. It's actually fused so at one point it was multiple bones. Sacrum at the alien. Right. So you have this sort of one fused sacrum and then you have these five lumbar discs numbered one through five. Now between each of those lumbar vertebral bodies is a disc. And then there's one between the fifth lumbar vertebral body and the sacrum. So we refer to them as, you know, L3, L4 is the disc between
Starting point is 01:12:42
three and four and L5, S1 is the disc between there. Behind each of these vertebral bodies, so these vertebral bodies are sort of held in place by the discs, but then also by the fissette joints that run behind them, and it's really difficult to show this. We'll probably have to pull up some images to make this easier for people to see, but the fissette joints and then sort of the lamina, which are these, those sort of longer bones, hold it all together,
Starting point is 01:13:08
but they don't really provide this support. I think the support is probably at the facet joints and at the disc interface. Is that probably fair? Yeah, and then think of all the musculature as the scaffolding and the levers and that help with that stabilization and then the activation of that deep stabilization
Starting point is 01:13:28
as an uprighting effect. And let's talk about which muscles are on the front of that. So if you were to cut me open here, and let's just say you pull everything out of the way, so you pull my bow, out of the way, you pull everything, and you go right down onto my spine, what are the muscles you're gonna see that are attached to the anterior or front portion of my vertebral bodies?
Starting point is 01:13:51
Two main ones that we can talk about is the soaz, which attaches to those transverse processes of the lumbar spine, and then the quadratus lumborum which also attaches to those processes. Both of those with those attachments they also come up and they attach right where the diaphragm attaches the crura of the diaphragm. So you know if you again maybe you can pull up those images and put it on the show notes. So you see all those kind of coalescing in that thoracic limbar region. If I have that ideal activation of that descending of the diaphragm and the facilitation of that intrebellum pressure, that pressure again that the so-as and the quadratus are anchoring off of. If that's compromised, they don't have anything to anchor off of, and then you see that excessive
Starting point is 01:14:56
extension and that overload of those facet joints. Exaggerate what the extension posture looks like so people can see it. So your hips will move forward. If you picture your pelvis as a bowl, you're tipping the bowl forward. Tipping the bowl forward, and then if you think of your ribcage, ribcage is coming forward as well. So your spine, which normally has a bend in it, gets more of a bend. Excessive, yeah. And with that oblique position of the diaphragm in the pelvic floor, now there's a mechanical
Starting point is 01:15:34
disadvantage of the abdominal wall. So we took a cylinder that's supposed to sit like this and we made it go to this. So now the tendency is going gonna be the extensor over activity and the flexor, the so-as. So now you're just getting this repetitive compression on those facet joints and the disc is getting this repetitive, hinging flexion. And then in the center of the disc,
Starting point is 01:16:02
we have the fluid or the nucleus working its way through those anionary fibers as they weaken. And then that's where you get the disc protrusions or substance can leak out. And the body will go into that spade, that protective spasm. You'll see the disc injury, but then you'll also see over time, facet hypertrophy. So the degenerative changes and the accumulation of bony material trying to help stabilize. So part of my story and kind of discovering, drove me into utilizing DNS, discovering prog school,
Starting point is 01:16:43
I developed what was called a Sponalolysis, which is stress fracture in the spine, part of the pars, which is kind of that arch that attaches the vertebrae and then to the facet joints. So for me, with overtraining poor recovery, poor postural foundations, I was premature and looking back, knowing what I know now, looking at pictures or videos of myself, I could see that compensatory pattern. It didn't catch up to me till college, you know, especially as we're younger, we have
Starting point is 01:17:26
a huge ability to compensate and we can get away with stuff. But in college, it caught up to me with a stress fracture. So I was kind of like the poster boy of upper and lower cross syndrome and lack of efficient stabilizing strategy. I had plenty of motivation and drive and practice, you know, hour upon hour, but at a certain point, structure overloaded in that, for me, a 405 region, that gave way. And when that gave way, then I went into this whole chronic pain cycle. And it wasn't until I went orthopedic, physical therapists, chiropractic, all of them helped in their own way, but it was, I knew there was something missing. So probably for self-satisfctions, I went into this profession trying to figure out my own pain and try to figure out how to recover.
Starting point is 01:18:26
And in medical school and some kind of practice school, first year, you're just getting bombarded with all anatomy, physiology, functional biomechanics. All of it was amazing and interesting, but I'm like, this isn't helping me. It wasn't until the second year where I was introduced to prog school, Yanda and Levitt and what they were teaching, it was like, oh, finally something made sense
Starting point is 01:18:53
and just intuitively it made sense to what I was dealing with. So I started to learn more and more about that while I was in school incorporating some of the treatment methods and that the exercises and that got me further along of kind of pulling myself out of my own kind of chronic pain. And then once I was out of school, 97, 98, after a few years there was a clinician, Dr. Liebinson, taking small groups over to Prague to learn from those pioneers and those prog therapists. So I was able to go over there. I think it was like an eight day intensive kind of lectures and workshops. Got to see Levit, but unfortunately the year before Yonda had passed away. I believe Vweta passed away, I think early 2000, 2001, but that was my first
Starting point is 01:19:56
introduction to Professor Pavel Kholage and at that time it was his ideas talking about developmental kinesiology and then utilizing that knowledge to develop the assessments and the treatment strategies not only to the cerebral palsy population, but then he was talking about the adults and then the sports population. So once I saw that, again, that was like another light bulb and another piece of that puzzle for me to work my way out of it, out of my own situation.
Starting point is 01:20:33
And then from 2003, basically, I've watched this evolution of DNS, the concepts and principles turn into the actual name and then the curriculum of where we're at now. Now, you're quite senior within the sort of international community of DNS. You're one of only 18 international instructors, isn't that about right? Yeah. What are the different levels of certification within DNS, the highest level being where
Starting point is 01:21:02
you're at? Can anybody attain that level or do you have to be a chiropractor or a physician or an osteopathic physician? Like what are they? Yeah. Yeah. So there's three tracks of the dynamic neuromuscular stabilization curriculum. One is a clinical track. It's a DNS A, B and C.
Starting point is 01:21:24
And then the fourth course is a D course, which you actually go to Prague, and it's like an intensive with the Prague therapist. There's a specific exercise sport sequence of courses. There's three courses there. The first one is focuss it in clinicians only type of thing. The second one is designed for trainers, as well as clinicians, because ideally we design that one, because we want the two populations working together and on the same page, but it's a little more focused towards less manual and more of what how you can integrate into a training program. The third is pediatrics, where you're going to utilize the DNS handling skills with infants. And that's a series of, I believe, three courses with a fourth culminating in Prague. So that curriculum, I believe,
Starting point is 01:22:27
started to come about 2009. And then off of that, we have specialty courses where we integrate different things. One of Prague schools, they don't want DNS to be a, this is a DNS technique. These are concepts and principles that Professor Kho Laj building on those founders and his experience and his ideas, it's meant to be integrated into everything else because it, that's one thing I love about it is you can easily integrate
Starting point is 01:23:06
it into the good work that you're already doing, whether you're a trainer, whether you're a clinician and you do a specific technique. For example, the product through the school therapist, they do visceral mobilization. They have specific soft tissue and mobilization techniques, and they're constantly exploring and trying to evolve the teaching and the integration. So it's a nice knowledge base and skill set to have again to enhance what you're already doing. This afternoon, we're going to go down and actually demonstrate a lot of this stuff by video
Starting point is 01:23:46
because I think that it's really challenging to talk about this stuff. It's just not that amenable to a discussion. It really has to be shown. And frankly, even showing it is challenging, I think, experiencing it is the gold standard. That's the ultimate. It's not just movements.
Starting point is 01:24:05
It's not just specific exercises, but it's facilitating the awareness of the ideal stabilization and the support. And then with my patients or whether it's training, I want my patients or my athletes to feel that synergy and feel that ability to stabilize where they need to, but then also relax where they need to. There's a little bit of a process. It's not a cookie cutter thing like just do this, this, this.
Starting point is 01:24:39
You have to put some work into it. You have to practice it both as a patient and as a clinician or trainer. And I guess that would be, you know, maybe one of the drawbacks for people is everything out there, people are doing good work and trying to help people. And if they have something that's working for them and we introduce these concepts and principles and they're not easily integrated, then maybe they don't they don't adapt them or they'll adapt a portion of them, which is fine as well. But it's it's something that in the curriculum, you know, we try to emphasize the need for feeling and practicing the movements that we can show later. I mean, I can only speak for myself, but I wonder if my generalization is correct. I think I guess would be that the people who come to DNS late in life with an injury get better,
Starting point is 01:25:42
but then stick with it are probably people who like to really tinker with things and like the toil away and don't necessarily need quick results, but can sort of anchor to a philosophy. They sort of have faith in it, and then they can sort of keep pursuing it because A, it feels a lot of the time like you're not doing much. And I think for someone who's used to being quite impatient with, I want results today, and hey, I just started CrossFit and two days later, I'm doing power cleans. Like, this is awesome. If that's the dopamine surge that a person needs, they're going to, I think they're going
Starting point is 01:26:18
to struggle with a system where you might spend a week daily practicing learning how to breathe again. And you'll never stop practicing that, by the way. You'll never stop practicing a really great breathing pattern, and a really great pattern of accessing these deep stabilizing muscles we've spoken about, and practicing all of these infant-like movements. And yes, it gets more challenging over time, and you do these flows that become quite enjoyable and can be very challenging. I mean, most of these things I still can't even do, actually, especially with weight. But I don't know. I guess I would say I always think of things in medicine through the lens of
Starting point is 01:26:55
efficacy and effectiveness. So efficacy is how well does something work if it's adhered to correctly. Effectiveness is if you just throw it out in the real world, how well does it work? To me, DNS might be the single most efficacious thing I have ever come across as far as healing injury and preventing injury. I'm not sure if it's the most effective thing, which is not a knock on it, but the point is, to your point earlier, a lot of people aren't gonna do it.
Starting point is 01:27:31
Especially once you get them out of pain, they're not gonna wanna stay with it. Now, I don't know why that is, but that's the thing that I would hope that DNS can improve upon in the next decade. It's only a decade old, but it's like, how do we take this thing that is so efficacious. Again, meaning if a person actually does it, they're going to get better.
Starting point is 01:27:52
It's almost impossible not to fix back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, like all of these injuries, they're going to get better. We want 90% of people to be able to stick to it once they start. Right. Part of that is with the curriculum, whether you're a clinician or a trainer, part of the process is with the assessment, you're training your eye. Just like a good coach will recognize something not right with the runner or the tennis player, the golf swing. DNS will have the specific assessment and those specific exercises based off of development. Once you develop your eye and recognize where the insuff It's like a good coach will recognize something not right with the runner or the tennis player or the golf swing. DNS will have the specific assessment and those specific exercises based off of development. Once you develop your eye and recognize where the insufficiency of stability within the swing, within the running, within the lift. So in my opinion, you can get to the point where you can utilize these concepts and principles, communicate them in a way, you know, to the deadlift or to the runner where you can help them in that manner.
Starting point is 01:29:04
Maybe they're not doing the specific developmental movement, but you're giving them ideas as far as loading, queuing that will facilitate that efficiency. And that's the challenge you're dealing with in Major League Baseball is you know that there's a way to get an extra four miles an hour out of a pitch, but you also know that that athlete probably doesn't want to or doesn't have the time to maybe I would argue they should have the time to but maybe doesn't want to go back and do all of the fundamental movements and master what an infant
Starting point is 01:29:34
does. So now your challenge is while you're on the pitching mound, how do I put a principle in you that's going to create a little more whip like stability. Right. Part of that is training up the staff that will be dealing with that athlete full, full time, the more skilled and movement towards mastery of that, the better it's going to be for the people that they work with. So part of that is that process, that education, that learning process, that's what I see people starting to ask for, to help with,
Starting point is 01:30:13
because a lot of people will take the course work and they're like, oh man, yeah, that's awesome. How do I integrate it? And that's also part of the curriculum. We've created specialty courses. So for example, there's certain expertise within Prague school. We have a Prague therapist that focuses on the running athlete. We have one of the instructors dance professionally.
Starting point is 01:30:39
So we have a dance specific exercise sport course. We've done golf, we've done baseball, Dr. Ome has a strength specific lifting specific course talking about that integration. So we're trying to create that curriculum to help with that integration. Because if we just have the standard courses, more of that's gonna tend to be clinical. But if we show how to actually do the integration within the specialty course, whoever's working with those athletes
Starting point is 01:31:17
or an athlete themselves, that's gonna be, we're gonna be able to communicate it better because they understand that sport. We even done a hockey specific, That's gonna be we're gonna be able to communicate it better because they understand that sport we even then Hockey specific one of the Czech therapists works with the national Czech national hockey team. So obviously huge experience and then we show the integration so that's part of That evolution of trying to communicate these concepts and principles better,
Starting point is 01:31:47
help people integrate them better so that we can, again, enhance what we're doing with our patients and with our athletes, or with our people that want to focus on performance. Well, Michael, this has been interesting, and I think it's gonna get a lot more interesting when we go and roll around in the mats a little bit and I think give a little bit more of a visual explanation of what a
Starting point is 01:32:09
lot of this stuff looks like. So thanks so much for sharing your insights and keeping up the fight. Thank you. That went faster than I thought. And I just feel like we scratched the surface. So looking forward to showing it to help people understand it a little bit better. Thank you. And hopefully once people see it, they'll want to take that next step, which is feeling
Starting point is 01:32:29
it. And I truly think that only when you feel this, do you understand it. And I think that's true of not just DNS. I think that's true of PRI and FRC and all these other things that we've spoken about that in my mind, all have a place in both the world of rehab and pre-heb. Yeah, if you can feel it, then you can start to integrate it and create that new pattern. So, thank you. Thank you for listening to this week's episode of The Drive.
