Hey everyone, welcome to the Peter Atia Drive. I'm your host, Peter Atia. The drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance, health, longevity, critical thinking, along with a few other obsessions along the way. I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world, and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality, more fulfilling life. If you enjoy this podcast, you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at peteratia-md.com.

Hey everybody, welcome to this week's episode of The Drive. I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support. If you're listening to this, you probably already know, but the two things I care most about, professionally, are how to live longer and how to live better. I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic. I practice it professionally, and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people

need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives. Curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy, and even before starting the podcast, that became clear to me. The sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this space is overwhelming. I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you. To take one example, our show notes are in a league of their own. In fact, we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those, and the feedback has mirrored this. So all of this raises a natural question. How will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this?
Starting point is 00:01:45
As you probably know, the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads, but after a lot of contemplation, that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons. Now the first and most important of these is trust. I'm not sure how you could trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it. Another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I just know myself. I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for. So if I don't feel that way about something, I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically.
Starting point is 00:02:19
So instead of selling ads, I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time. And that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience. This keeps my relationship with you, both simple and honest. If you value what I'm doing, you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you. In exchange, you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free. It's that simple.
Starting point is 00:02:45
It's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at, you will get back more than you give. So for example, members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes, including other things that we plan to build upon, such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode. These are useful beyond just the podcast, especially given the technical nature of many of our shows. Members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular Ask Me Anything episodes.
Starting point is 00:03:19
That means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out. Lastly, and this is something I'm really excited about, I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love. And as I said, we're not taking ad dollars from anyone, but instead, what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love
Starting point is 00:03:40
and would already talk about for free, and have them pass savings on to you. Again the podcast will remain free to all, but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one, the podcast itself, and two, the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you. I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this. If you learn from and find value in the content I produce, please consider supporting us directly by signing up from monthly subscription.

Another month and another AMA. Welcome to AMA number six. With me, your host, and my header research Bob Kaplan. As a reminder, these are for subscribers only. And if you are a subscriber, you'll be able to watch and listen to this full episode on our website. If you're listening to this on a podcast player, you will hear a preview now, and then you'll have to go over to our site to hear or watch the remainder. Based on the topics we cover in this AMA,
Starting point is 00:04:35
I have a feeling this one will be a fan favorite, which also ends in one of my favorite AMA moments as we have a special guest, Silky Years. In this episode, we talk about vitamins. Do you need to supplement them if you need a balanced diet? What's the deal with antioxidants? I go over my entire fasting framework, how to break a fast, what breaks a fast?
Starting point is 00:04:54
Does caffeine or coffee constitute that? How do you optimize it? What type of supplements should you be taking? I think I went into some detail on time restricted feeding. What does it mean to do 16-8 versus 18-6, and some of these things? And I talk about how I use time-restricted feeding to prepare for a huge food day, such as Thanksgiving.
Starting point is 00:05:13
I also go into intermittent fasting, which I distinguish from time-restricted feeding as periods of true fasting, sort of three days, five days, seven days, et cetera. I go into a bit of our process of learning and the importance of using a framework, which anyone who knows me personally knows I'm pretty emphatic about.
Starting point is 00:05:29
And of course, talk a little bit about some of the podcasts that I like to listen to, and we close it out with a little cameo of silky ears. Hey Peter, long time reader here. First time caller. Long time first time. What do you think of the assertion by many doctors and researchers that if you eat a balanced diet?
Starting point is 00:05:50
IE, low in process, foods, high in fruits and vegetables, that supplementation is completely unnecessary, and in fact, you're probably just peeing away most of the nutrients, thoughts. Yeah, that's tough, because supplementation is such a broad concept that I don't know what we're really referring to there. So, for example, would taking vitamin A or vitamin C or vitamin E be required under the circumstances
Starting point is 00:06:18
you describe almost assuredly not? It was A, E, D, and K, you're not necessarily peeing those out because they're fat soluble. Yeah, those are fat soluble, so yeah. But it's hard to say that you don't require any supplementation. I think that's a bit of an open question. In fact, we did a podcast a while ago with Chris Masterjohn, where we went super deep on the B vitamins, and in fact, the role of B vitamins in people that have mutations
Starting point is 00:06:42
in an enzyme that is responsible in part four of the methylation of these things. So I guess I'd have to take some issue with that. I understand that that's a very, like that's the cool kid approach today. I think people love to be cool today and sort of say, well, supplementation is a scam and you don't need any supplements. And I understand why people say that because the opposite end of that argument is equally nonsensical in my mind, which is like, you need to take 2,000 supplements a day and you need to supplement like biotin levels and stuff like that. I think that's also sort of equally silly.
Starting point is 00:07:16
So I guess no, I would sort of disagree with that. But I'd also put this in the context of, we might be splitting hairs. In other words, if you're really eating an awesome diet and you're exercising really well and you're sleeping really well and you're getting lots of outdoor exposure to sunlight, making your own vitamin D, etc. etc. What's the difference between you being on theoretically the most optimized supplement regimen versus not?
Starting point is 00:07:44
It might be so small that it's sort of like we're picking the wrong thing to discuss. I think one thing too to maybe differentiate is if you have a deficiency versus superphysiological doses is probably the one of the things so that I've never calculated this, maybe somebody has where they, you read these articles about super foods, all the foods that you must include in your diet every day. I just want to add all those up. You'd be the stay puff marshmallow man, nice ghost busters for reference right there. Scores and points there. That being said, I do think that super foods are super if they're providing something that
Starting point is 00:08:24
you are deficient in. Because then you'll feel like, wow, this is life changing because I had some deficiency and now I've made it up. Right. If you have zero vitamin C, you're in a bad place. If you have zero vitamin D, you're in a bad place. Having vitamin C above the level upon which you can make enough pro-line to make enough
Starting point is 00:08:46
collagen to not get scurvy, not that helpful. That said, look, there are some other interesting applications here. I do think there's, I'd love to see some research done on mega-dose intravenous vitamin C for viral infections. There was some research that was done on this, I think, in the 60s. My recollection is it looked sort of interesting, but wasn't really followed through upon. Obviously, Linus Pauling, who himself is a two-time Nobel laureate, although I think one
Starting point is 00:09:11
of them was a Nobel Peace Prize and not to diminish the Nobel Peace Prize, but I sort of fit some of the different. He was close on elucidating the structure of DNA, too, right, with Crick and Watson. He was either on their heels or right there. Yeah, but Pauling was a huge proponent of Vitamin C. And he was given enormous rain to sort of propose this and put this forward in large part because of his credentials.
Starting point is 00:09:33
Though I think for the most part people today view many of his views with respect to hypodoses of Vitamin C is sort of nonsensical. There's a book of letters by Richard Feynman. Back in the day, people used to write letters, rather than, I guess, email and tweets and things like that. And there's a letter from Linus Pauling to Richard Feynman. And then I think a Richard Feynman response,
Starting point is 00:09:57
but Feynman was diagnosed with... It's a phagyocansar. It's a phagygial cancer, and Pauling was putting in his two sense and his words of encouragement and things like that, but he talked about vitamin C and I think a couple of other things. And it was almost like organic foods and things like that, which was pretty interesting. Hey everyone, hope you enjoyed a sneak peek of this AMA.
