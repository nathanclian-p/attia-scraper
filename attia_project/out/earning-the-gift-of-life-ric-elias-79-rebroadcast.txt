Now without further delay, here's today's episode. Welcome to a special episode of The Drive. For those of you who subscribed to our newsletter, you probably saw this week we celebrated our fourth anniversary, so for those of you who don't, just want to let you know we're four years old. Today's podcast, we figured it'd be a great time to ensure folks have had a chance to hear my initial conversation with Rick which was released back in November 2019. I met Rick in 2013 and I was kind of a fan boy. I had seen his TED Talk probably a year or so sooner. It immediately became probably my favorite TED Talk that I'd
Starting point is 00:01:21
ever seen and a mutual friend who knew how much my fan I was, introduced us. And to this day, it really remains one of the most amazing talks that in such short order puts everything into perspective. Rick is a dear friend. We've become close to over the years, and he's a wonderful mentor to me.
Starting point is 00:01:38
In our discussion, we talk about the day that would change Rick's life forever. When on January 15th, 2009, Rick was on US Airways flight 1547, which made an emergency landing into the Hudson River. I'm sure many of you remember this. Rick dives really deep into how that day impacted his life and changed his perspective on everything, including his relationships with his family
Starting point is 00:01:57
and the broader community. The episode is really an opportunity to allow Rick to share so much of his wisdom. And it's really one of those episodes that I think everyone needs to hear at least once and probably twice. So I'm going to be going back to listen to it again this week, and I hope you enjoy, or potentially re-enjoy my conversation with my close friend, Rick Elias. Rick, thank you so much for making time.
Starting point is 00:02:24
I know you're super busy this week, but when your office was able to coordinate us getting together, I was delighted. It is so much fun to be with you today, Peter. I'm a huge fan of your podcast and we're dear friends, so when you ask me to be on it, I was honored. A lot of people have heard me talk about you. I wrote a blog post, I don't know, probably five years ago about how your TED talk was at the time and actually still remains my favorite TED talk of all time. It's a very short
Starting point is 00:02:50
talk and I'm sure for folks who haven't heard it yet, we'll make sure we link to it. But I can't resist starting with that story. So let's just put the perfundery niceties aside and just go straight to it. Thursday, January 15th, 2009, you're in New York City. Why were you here? I was here because one of our partners directly at the time was here and I was having lunch with the CMO. The night before I had dinner with a good friend of mine
Starting point is 00:03:17
and was having a couple small meetings in the morning and then I was flying home to coach my son's basketball team when I landed in Charlotte. The flight was going from like, what, here to Charlotte? How many times did you take that shuttle, that flight, that's probably a common flight? 100 times. You remember having breakfast that morning?
Starting point is 00:03:33
I went to play hoops in the Reba Club on the Upper East Side. And it was a cold morning, and it was knowing big flakes. And I chose to walk because it was so beautiful. How would you describe your life at that point in time? How big was Red Ventures, your company? We had about 700 employees. We've gone in this really nice growth spurt after really struggling the first four years. We started in 2000. So we were doing really well, but we were at risk of two bad things happening and not having a business So there was this kind of constant juxtaposition of this is not gonna last I actually told our employees enjoy the good old days
Starting point is 00:04:14
They won't last forever and they were annoyed by me saying that but it was the reminder that this was very fleeting Would you have described yourself as happy person Like how would people describe Rick back then? Yeah, generally I'm a very positive person. I like to think that I've lived through a lot of great things in my life, some that have actually happened. I have seen how I see where I've been since I was a kid. That said, I was super stressed. I was trying to build a business so that we could tell it and I could go do other things in life. Your kids at the time were how old? My daughter was in first grade, my son was in second grade. And so how were you thinking about balancing the incredible stress of running a 700 person
Starting point is 00:04:56
company, the travel that comes with that and then being the dad, being the coach, being the husband? Was that balance, did it feel in balance to you? Looking back, it was completely out of balance. I rationalized myself around quality over quantity. I literally talked myself into, at least I'm coaching my son. I was like, many of us are doing those stages just really taxed mentally. And my wife really carried the burden of raising our kids. And I looked back on it and it was 95-5 when it should have been a different number.
Starting point is 00:05:31
Geez. Yeah. 95-5, I can relate. You were staying at a hotel that morning when you got up? And then remember the hotel that was in the Upper East because of basketball in the morning, which it was priority. Like a running a basketball.
Starting point is 00:05:44
5.30 a.m. run, which is great. This is pre-Uber, I'm guessing, yeah, 2009. So you probably took a taxi to LaGuardia. Yes. Do you remember anything about your transit from getting through security, getting on that plane, anything about it? It was hard given that it's such a routine for you.
Starting point is 00:05:59
Yes, I do remember. Because of that impact, everything around it becomes kind of much more real, but it's a wacky story I remember I was a little early which I never was and I went and got a soft-served ice cream at McDonald's And I worked out really hard that morning and that was the only place where I did this and you know I think that it'll change that all-eating area, but I'm making love to this ice cream. It just tastes so freaking good. I'm literally just enjoying my vanilla ice cream while I wait for whatever an hour for my flight, and I start walking to the gate, and it was so good that I turned around and
Starting point is 00:06:34
went and had another one, which I've never done. I can relate to that as well, by the way. Although soft-serve ice cream isn't a particular weakness of mine, but there are other airport weaknesses I have. Trail mix is my airport weakness. That's why you look the way you do in the way I look. I don't know. I would say the ice cream is probably no worse for you than the trail mix, by the way.
Starting point is 00:06:57
So they call you guys to board on the plane. You're sitting at the front of the plane. Yeah. It was a really kind of crappy day. It was gray, it was cold, it was wet, kind of gone out of snow and rain. So it was not the most pleasant day in New York. So I boarded, what was in first class,
Starting point is 00:07:14
so we boarded first. And I remember sitting in my seat and kind of processing, okay, here's all the stuff I got to do on the plane. As soon as I land, I got to do this. And then when I come back, and that brand is super busy. Just thinking about the non-never ending list of things to accomplish.
Starting point is 00:07:30
You listening to music or anything, you know? I'm not. I'm just sitting there kind of veging a little bit, just thinking about life. So 2009, we would have been sort of third generation iPhone and Blackberry were probably the dominant things, which one were you using? I had just switched.
Starting point is 00:07:45
Littlely, like two days before. So you're on like an early iPhone? Early iPhone. Then the first row, so you can't have a bag on there, your legs, they have to go up. And so I'm sitting there and it was a little bit of a slow departing. I think because of the weather, things kind of back up. What time was it? This afternoon.
Starting point is 00:08:03
It was like a two thirty or something like that. And I remember kind of dosing, you know, the plane puts you to sleep. And so I was kind of going in and out of that as the plane took off. And I was very cognizant when we kind of took off. I was kind of in and out of consciousness, right when we took off. How long after the takeoff do you know something is not right? So about three minutes, I think we're about 4500 feet up or something like that, there's a massive explosion. Bam!
Starting point is 00:08:32
Like a pipe bomb. And this was 10 years after September 11th, but it's still September 11th and all of us will live through that. And I had this really lucky seat because I can see the flight attendant kind of kitty corner. I looked at her, we were still flying, we were horizontal and I looked at her and she was calm. Her eyes were calm. And I was like, okay, we probably lost an engine.
Starting point is 00:08:57
And for the next couple of minutes, Peter, all you could hear was the engine struggling, like they were trying to restart it when you go look at the engine struggling. Clah, clah, clah, clah, clah. Like they were trying to restart it when you go look at the transcript, that's where they were doing. There was a really nasty smell going into the cabin. So it smelled like a really bad burn. So it burned?
Starting point is 00:09:14
Yeah, burned, burned and kind of not. He had turned the plane pretty quickly. We were heading back into New York. And my mind, I'm like, okay, I'm not coaching today. The flight attendant's eyes told me, oh, I had to hear, which is, it's gonna be a long travel day. So when you're leaving LaGuardia, you're up and circling around, so you're sort of over queens.
Starting point is 00:09:34
Yes. And you shouldn't be coming back over Manhattan, correct? Right, correct. So what do you see out the window? I am in the aisle. You're in the aisle, so I'm not really seeing out the window necessarily. I'm just little Lee for this two minutes just going like wow this is really bizarre. I got to figure out who's coaches practice for my son. And you know that's all I was
Starting point is 00:09:54
thinking about was the next sign that something was wrong the reduction in sound in the cabin. So about 90 seconds before we hit down. So two minutes pass of this of the engine trying to restart. Right. And then Captain Salenberger gets on the voice system for the first time. And he only says three words. He says brace for impact. At the same time, they turn off the struggling engines. And he lines up the plane with the Hudson River. You and I have been here long enough, don't plan enough that there's no runway right at the end of the Hunts of River. So I knew in that moment, 100% was certainty that we were going to die.
Starting point is 00:10:37
I looked at the flight attendant's eyes and it was no longer annoyance. It was complete terror. I didn't know this, but in airline speak, that means we're not landing at an airport. And all of this happened in 90 seconds from when you... Two minutes. So there's a two minutes from hitting to when he does that. And then there's 90 seconds as he's gliding the plane down. But you literally... Because you're now at the very top of Manhattan when this is happening, right? Carapiting, right? All the way up.
Starting point is 00:11:02
Yeah. And you have 90 seconds to basically say goodbye to your life. What is really unique about that experience is you are 100% certain you're going to die. If anything, I was saying to myself, please blow up. I don't want this to break in 50 pieces and drown in this cold water. So you're kind of playing all this things out. And you are just realizing that there's no suffering. So you're not burning or drowning or something that would make it different, but you have 90 seconds to say goodbye.
Starting point is 00:11:32
But you still don't know what that end is like. Do you? I mean, it's not to get too morbid. But if I were in that situation, I wouldn't actually understand what the end is. I just seen enough documentaries to know that planes on land and water. Yeah, they break into a million pieces and they spiral open. I didn't know how, but I know what was going to happen. And at this point, it's silent in the cockpit or are people screaming? It was more silent than screaming. I'm in first roads, so I can't hear a ton.
Starting point is 00:12:00
And you go into, imagine the amount of adrenaline that is going through your system as you are literally trapped to your death for 90 seconds. Did you think I have time to make one phone call? I didn't have my phone. Your phone is up top. Yeah. It was very cleansing. I looked back and I was raised Catholic. So first thing that crosses my mind is like,
Starting point is 00:12:20
okay, I'm not a practicing Catholic, but you can repent and all sorts of good things could happen, right? And I asked myself that question, am I going to do something that I've chosen not to believe in this part of my life. And I didn't. And I said, I'm not a hypocrite. It may be, meaning I'm going to live with the choices I've made. Yes. Which was interesting for me to after my relationship with religion and software, but it was very powerful 90 seconds because the most important thing I realized was, wow, this all changed in an instant. I thought I had years. And now it's all old. How old were you on that day? I was 42. How old are you? 46. I thought we
Starting point is 00:13:03
tend to believe we're going to live forever. And it would all change in an instant. And there was, I really had a ton of regret about the things that I did not get to. Things, experiences, people I needed to ask for forgiveness from. People I wanted to say again, I love you. People I wanted to hug one more time. And you're like, wow, it all changed. And then there's no going back and there's no turning that back. And that was one emotion. The other emotion and also around regret was really how much I had allow my ego to become very active in my life and how I spend so much time being wrong by people or just spending so much time trying to be right versus choosing to be happy.
Starting point is 00:13:51
I realize, wow, I've lived my life in a very wasteful way because so much of my energy has been spent on things that did not matter with people that did. They think about all the fights you've had with pick your wife. You don't even remember, you know, 30 days later what you thought about, yeah, you were so passionate about it. It just doesn't make a freaking matter. Yeah. You know, and then the last kind of regret because that's what it felt like was this notion that I had not
Starting point is 00:14:17
focused on the thing that matters most in my life. I inherently knew that my most important responsibility was to make sure my kids were the best versions of themselves and I had completely delegated that to my wife in a very unfair way. And I had prioritized not just work but just everything else. And so those were regrets. And I literally thought about all of that, but you know what was really interesting, Peter? I literally thought about all of that, but you know what was really interesting, Peter? Dying to me was not scary. I always thought it would be a scary moment.
Starting point is 00:14:50
It was super sad, because I didn't want to go. I really liked my life. I really wasn't done. I had lots of regrets, but it was not scary. And that in itself also has been clarifying for me. Had you spoken, or have you since spoken about this with the other people on the flight? And do you know if any of them felt that?
Starting point is 00:15:09
I have not, I have not. I had so much support when I landed on love and all that that I kinda stayed within my realm of comfort and then immediately after there were also two things, books and lawsuits and this and it all felt so disingenuous to me. The US Airway sent us a check for $10,000 and I refused to. I've seen your check. You've seen it.
Starting point is 00:15:30
It's sitting in Jay Walker's library. Yes. You probably the only person that didn't catch that check. You know what? It just does the back karma. I didn't know why I didn't catch that check. It's not the right thing. I don't know how big it would have been in a million bucks. I would have not cashed it. I don't matter how big it would have been a million bucks, I would have not catch it. I was given the ultimate gift.
Starting point is 00:15:47
And the ultimate gift was to say goodbye to your life, to close your eyes, to touch your own arm, say I love you, to wish for it to blow up, and to open your eyes and realize that you had a second chance. As the plane is coming down, do you see the George Washington Bridge? Can you see it?
Starting point is 00:16:08
Oh yeah. I saw it more as we were going over it, and you can see the cars that are scarily close place. Like literally we... You see cars in a level you never see them in an airplane. I wonder. You see the level of detail. Detail.
Starting point is 00:16:20
And we almost took on that bridge. I don't know if you've seen the movie, but if he chooses to go to Titorboro, we take out a bunch of buildings. He literally made all these calculations that he didn't have enough thrust to get there. And he said, the only chance I have is to go in the water.
Starting point is 00:16:39
And you will relate to this story because I know the struggle or your internal fight against authority when it's not well placed. And we talked a lot about this. So when he communicates to the tower and said, I'm going in the water. And the tower goes like, please repeat, because they can't understand. And then basically he was done with protocol.
Starting point is 00:17:00
He's like, I'm going to do my best to try to land this thing. There's all sorts of mathematical equations here. And we landed, I think, at 151 miles an hour, something like that. If we are at 1.53, we blow up at 149. We tip the wind blows like 12 1,000 hours at 14 this game. Like, there were so many things that had to be within such a small degree, all compounding
Starting point is 00:17:23
into a moment that you can land a cylinder with 158 people full of gas. That's a kidding cement. Yeah, I just know that from sort of the literature on people who jump off bridges and into water. And when you jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, which is something like 220 feet up, much lower than where you guys are coming from, it is like hitting cement. And the only people who survived that jump are generally people who land exactly feet first.
Starting point is 00:17:49
They end up breaking most bones. They break every bone in their feet, ankles, compress the spine. But at least they don't pivot land sideways, have a rib tear through their liver or something awful like that. So yeah, it's like a cement, a wet cement landing. I don't know if I've ever told you this story,
Starting point is 00:18:07
but about five years ago, I met a guy through a friend. We were in Houston and the three of us were having dinner. And somehow it came up that this guy was in a helicopter crash. He was the only one that survived. He was a pilot three, maybe three or four other people in the helicopter and him. And there was a technical malfunction in the helicopter. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was one of those things where it was clear
Starting point is 00:18:30
they were crashing and it was clear they were all going to die. The helicopters just looked like the most unstable things when they're out of control. And interestingly, it was about the same length of time. He had about two minutes of crashing and he hadn't heard of you. So he hadn't seen your TED Talk. After the fact he did, of course, I directed him to it. And what blew my mind, Rick, was the similarity in the way he described that two minutes. He said, he said, Peter, you'll think this is crazy, but I just wasn't afraid to die. But boy, was I sad. He was about your age. He was probably 40 when this
Starting point is 00:19:03
happened. He was hurt in the crash. I mean, he broke both his legs. I mean, he was, again, the only survivor but walked away with his life. I'll never forget that. How he explained something about not being afraid but just being so sad. Yeah, it makes me wonder how many other people on that plane would echo that same thought.
Starting point is 00:19:20
Obviously, I can't relate. So I don't know what that means. I feel like I'd be afraid, but I'm looking at a man who's been through it and tells me that that's not what he felt. I just bought a lucky ticket. So when did you close your eyes? How far do you think you were above the water?
Starting point is 00:19:34
When you fly a lot, you can almost sense when you're going to hit, even if you're dosing off, you feel the ground coming, right? So in about 10 seconds left, I can feel the countdown in my system in 10, 9, and that's when I grabbed my arm and I said I love you. Why did you do that? I think I've had a sense of needing comfort as you exit life. I probably there was probably a lot of acceptance in that statement subconsciously. Prior to that were you someone who struggled with loving yourself?
Starting point is 00:20:08
Were you hard on yourself? No, no, no, no. I'm many issues, that's not one of them. That's interesting. I'm very hard on myself. I wonder if I would even have the foresight to think that. It's a beautiful sentiment. What was the sound like?
Starting point is 00:20:23
It was, he puts the tail and then kind of the nose just jams. So it was a violin accident and then we skit to the left. I have my eyes closed, I open my eyes and I am completely disoriented. Because I'm expecting to be upside down. If I left my eyes open, I think I would have been much more oriented and it took me a split second to realize that this looked like a cruise ship. Yeah, this plane sitting on the water kind of all around this. When your eyes open, the plane is still moving, I don't remember. I don't think so. I think it can't stop or close to coming to a stop. Was there any part of you that thought this is death, I'm dead, this is an afterlife,
Starting point is 00:21:07
this is sort of a few circuits firing in what remains of my central nervous system, but I'm actually dead like, I mean, I, again, what is... It did to me, you would think that that would be a very realistic, it just was so quick, right, that it was confusing, it was unusual, you know, when you have zero probability of something and it happens, you're like, did that really happen? And immediately we went into kind of holy cow. We got to get out of here.
Starting point is 00:21:33
Do you have a moment of realizing what has happened? Or do you immediately shift into business mode of, okay, now it's an emergency excavation. Now it's like all that stuff that nobody pays attention to when the plane is taking off the slide How does the slide work who takes the door off how many doors are there where is the nearest or all that stuff you guys go right into that mode and is it orderly Is it chaotic are people screaming clapping crying what's happening that plane was not equipped for water. That's why people were standing on the wings, not on rafts. I don't understand. If you look, uh, yeah, in the coach section, there were no rafts because that plane was not supposed to go over water. So that's why nothing deploy when you open those emergency doors. Only you can stand on
Starting point is 00:22:23
the wings. I thought every plane had that. If the plane had landed on the east side, there's not the ferries and the hustle and bustle of where we landed. That thing was taking water. They evacuated the people from the wing because we were sinking. So there were so many things.
Starting point is 00:22:38
There were a bunch of ferries around us as soon as we landed. So it never felt like we were not going to be safe in that regard. But on the east side, I think it would have been different. How cold was the water? Do you remember the feeling? It was very cool. But adrenaline takes over. So it's only cold after it wasn't cold in the moment. And I'll tell you a story that I have really not share with many people. I think it because I tire from hoping and staying out late and working and all this stuff
Starting point is 00:23:05
and eating so much sugar before I can't complain. I'm kind of comatose sitting there on my seat as people are boarding late in the boarding process. Elderly lady in a wheelchair and her is coming down the ramp. And my voice inside of me and I've done this before says, get up, keep up your seat. Go sit and coach. I'm 65, but you know what, it's the right thing to do. And then I'm like, I'm tired, you know, it's not a long fly, and I'm being completely selfish.
Starting point is 00:23:33
And then her daughter is behind the person that is helping the lady. I'm out there's two of them. We can't do it. And I'm pretty sure this guy won't give the seat right, so I rationalize myself to being completely selfish. So once we are in the rafts, and I know that this elderly lady's in the back of the plane, I start freaking out because I know she can't walk. So I start screaming, where's the lady? Where's the lady? We're in the raft. And by the way, it was really interesting in the raft. And in our side, some people were completely frozen. They couldn't understand anything. Some people were panicking in the raft, and then there was a handful of us
Starting point is 00:24:07
that were like, okay, let's problem solve. And eventually the older lady comes to the front of the plane, they bring her in because they got to put her in a raft and I grab her and I'm sitting there and she's completely traumatized by this. And I'm just thinking about, oh my goodness, my last act would have been one of my most selfish acts. It was an interesting emotion and then when we got to the ferry we had to climb
Starting point is 00:24:31
about 10 steps. Everybody evacuated out of the bigger guy and I'm saying I'll bring this lady up. The guys were trying to hold her. Peter, I think something crazy happened as I'm going up this frozen ladder with no gloves, no anything, no jacket, and I'm holding her basically in my chest, my hand slips. I was within a split second of dropping an 80 year old in the water, and I grabbed and that was a very, all of this has happened in this moment as soon as I got to the top of the boat. And she will say, we were all safe. I started crying. Like the river of emotion was insane.
Starting point is 00:25:15
What about others? Did they experience that? I mean, I'm guessing that different people are processing this at totally different speeds. There are probably still people who don't actually understand what has happened. It sounds like you've moved. You're in post processing on some level. Are you talking amongst each other? No. Everybody as soon as one of the people in the ferry, I grabbed the phone. I really wanted to call my wife. to call my wife. By then, she was a deputetrician with the kids, and her sister, Collar, and goes, where's Rick?
Starting point is 00:25:47
And she said, he's coming from New York. She goes, turn the TV on and Brenda turned the TV. And she thought that we all had died. So she's crying at the pediatricians. The kids are screaming. And I call from a random number. And as she tells a story, she thinks that the police saying, hey, your husband died.
Starting point is 00:26:03
Right, random. You're a random number. And I say, yeah. tells a story. She thinks that the police saying, hey, your husband died. Right. Random. You remember? Yeah. And I call and I say, honey, I'm okay. And like she screams, he's alive. He's alive. And the kids are completely confused. They just lost their dad. And he's alive. And so everybody were passing on this phone and all that. Where was the crew at this time? So most people ended up on the New York side, some people ended up in the New Jersey side, I ended up in the New York side
Starting point is 00:26:29
and I think it was peer 42. And my guess is the crew is the last to get off the plane. They have to make sure everybody's off and I'm guessing Sully is the last of the last. 100% and he ends up, I'll tell you a quick story on Sully. So we end up in, in my way, New York is an amazing city in so many ways. Yeah, if something's gonna go wrong, this is the city to have it happen. You've got the best rescue.
Starting point is 00:26:52
You've got, believe it, well, the first responders, by the time we got to the pier, there were like, there's hot chocolate waiting for you. The red cross and, you know, there were priests and rabbis and everybody and they're kind. And like, it was amazing. Like, we were sitting there and they're interviewing everybody because they don't know if I'll play or whatever right them before they release anybody they need to interview everybody three hours later they release
Starting point is 00:27:12
they start putting us in buses to take us to a hotel and captain's home burger standing there what it looked like fully dressed you know the stoic probably contemplating what in the world just happened. And I went up to him, there's nobody around him. And I went up to him and said, Captain, I didn't know his name. I said, thank you for saving our lives. And Peter, he said something to me that day that I say to myself all the time when someone thanks me for something.
Starting point is 00:27:39
I don't say it out loud much. You know what he said to me? He said I was just doing my job. Can you imagine if we all just kind of did our jobs at every level? That really shocked me that that was his process. So they put us on a bus and the media is there and all of that and we get to the hotel and there's food and they were amazing. And they're like, okay, you want to hotel, the train is tomorrow. I don't know. Many people lived here and I looked at the lady and I said, I need to get on the next flight. I'll what time it's the next flight. And she looked at me like I got hit in the head, right? She's coming in contention pro-dial. I was like, this guy has completely lost it.
Starting point is 00:28:24
And the way I said it to myself was like, listen, the probability of this happening She's coming in contention pro-dice. Like this guy has completely lost it. I mean, the way I said it to myself is like, listen. The probability of this happening twice is like if this plane goes down and I die, it's me God is coming to see you, right? Let's go get this over with. If it dies and I don't die, you hope we're a win free and I'm gonna share a stage
Starting point is 00:28:39
somewhere and if I get on this plane, I'll never be afraid of flying again. Did you fly out that night? I flew out that night. What did you feel like when that plane was taking off? How did it feel different? I remember the next time I took a flight, which was maybe a couple weeks later. And I had a seat, again, I got upgraded at first class and I gave it up and I wanted to sit
Starting point is 00:29:01
in the first seat of coaching. I wanted to see me on that plane. And I sat on the left-hand side of the plane and I just watched. I needed to relive all of that. That flight, I just wanted to come home. My mom and dad picked me up because my wife was at home with the kids. They were young and our home got 60 people within an hour and they all came and did like everything. But nothing had really happened. We were fine. But it's just beautiful love and beautiful expression of support and community and so my parents picked me up and
Starting point is 00:29:32
there's media and everybody there and I like squirt around and I don't want any like people are talking to the camera and whatever and you can see when you look at the footage I'm like pretending I'm a normal passenger in the plane. And my mom, it's all a 5-3 at the time she was 70, so she's about to turn 80. And I remember giving a hug to my dad and giving a hug to my mom in feeling like this was the safest place in the world. A little lady hugging a 6 five foot guy was the safest place and I remember feeling like a kid again, I had asthma as a kid and that was the only place that I could breathe. And it was so beautiful to embrace my mom in a way that again, it started this journey of I am not taking anything for granted. And that hug was like the switch. And there's not a day that goes by that I will not do something
Starting point is 00:30:29
and remind myself I'm not taking this for granted. And I love that hug with my mom. My mom has fairly advanced Alzheimer's now, as you know. And so those hugs are not there anymore the same way, but I am so glad I was able to be a kid again as it relates to hugging her. We were together a few months ago and you mentioned to me that you had never seen Captain Sullenberger since that day you saw him on the docks and then you saw him for the first time.
Starting point is 00:30:58
You had just seen him for the first time. Tell me about that. So, one of our companies is the Point Sky. And the Point Sky has a big award show here at the Intrepid, and he was going to be the guest of honor and Brian, who is the Point Sky and a good partner and a good friend. He's like, hey, would you like to introduce him? And I said, I will be honored. Why had you not sought him out earlier?
Starting point is 00:31:21
I wasn't ready. I have a big idea that I have. I'm been working on and I'm going to do something my way. I just had said thank you to him that day and I know he's been overburdened and I said the world will bring our energies again. And so we're in the red carpet this big of an hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people all sorts of things and he knows that I'm introducing him and he knows that I was a passenger. And I'm like, I am so curious as to how I'm gonna react. I see him, I shake his hand, we embrace,
Starting point is 00:31:54
we locked out. Before you were introduced to him. Before. And Peter, not a word came out of my mouth. There was nothing coming out of my mouth. And it was amazing. And it didn't have to come out of my mouth. He could see my eyes what I wanted to say in a way that was so deep and he understood and I saw in his eyes.
Starting point is 00:32:12
A connection that two human beings can't manufacture. It was really an amazing moment to see the person that saved your life and then to have the honor of introducing him a couple hours later and give him an award. How did you even think about and prepare for making introductory remarks in that setting? Did you wing it? Did you plan it? I planned it, but I didn't write it, just like the TED Talk. I'm not a great memorizer, but I need to have a framework and I need to let my heart go. I told a few stories when I introduced them up that day of a very kind guy that basically gave everything he had that day
Starting point is 00:32:49
to all of us and he was going on there and I talked about the first responders and I told the story of him doing his job as the core of this but what was unique to him is literally he had prepared for that moment his whole life. And I went through his background as a, as an instructor and maybe as a gliding instructor, all the things that he had done was because he will tell other pilots, you're only a pilot when you lose an engine. And he literally had prepared his whole life to be a pilot, not for the tens of hours he flown, but for the moment that he lost an engine, that he didn't think it would be too.
Starting point is 00:33:29
So I admired him doing his job. Do you get the sense from all you now know about the details of that, what percentage of pilots that fly commercial airlines could have done that under the same setting? I mean, we can never know the answer to that, and I'm guessing the answer isn't a lot, I commercial airlines could have done that under the same setting. I mean, we can never know the answer to that, and I'm guessing the answer isn't a lot, but I know very little about this, of course, but watching the movie, reading the book, that sort of thing. But it seemed like improbable that a lot of people could have acted the way he did because
Starting point is 00:34:02
of the length of time they had to process it. To me, it was maybe I'm incorrect, by the way, because I'm not a pilot. Maybe I don't even understand all the nuance. But to me, the single most important thing was how quickly he could process information and make a decision about what to do. And even a pilot with more technical skill, and I don't know how much more technical skill one could have or need. But if you took an extra 15 seconds to come to the same decision, it wouldn't have mattered. To your point earlier, if he had tried to go to Tieterboro, no way, you're plowing over
Starting point is 00:34:36
land, if not hitting the bridge on the way to New Jersey. If he tried to turn to LaGuardia, he's probably plowing through Manhattan at that point. So, I don't know, I mean, I just... I think the answers close to zero, if not zero, because there are a bunch of factors. I think he... because he was a gliding instructor. I don't know, many of them are out there, but it was what allowed him to place that plane in the water in a way Because he had taught flying for so long and he had prepared pilots for this, but more importantly There were all those factors that all had to fit within a very narrow margin So even him in other moments where other factors go and then there's a lot of luck
Starting point is 00:35:20
One of those wings tips the water and we go through it. So The odds of that kind of situation happening, it's close to zero. Do you remember the scene in saving Private Ryan at the end of the movie when the character played by Tom Hanks is dying and Private Ryan who's been saved? Basically is sort of coming to grips with the realization that in an effort to save his life an entire group of men have died and The character played by Tom Hanks basically says to him just two words Earn this. Did you feel
Starting point is 00:35:55
some sense of Look, I've always lived my life. I didn't know you before this But I'm imagining you were not that different a person. I don't think you like you overnight became the great guy you are today. But did you feel a bigger sense of obligation to your community, both your immediate community, meaning your family, but your larger community, which is your company, and then the even broader community than that, which is the world around you? Is that changed in any way? A hundred percent.
Starting point is 00:36:22
A couple of days later, in my own quietness, I was trying to make sense of all of this now. And I made a commitment to myself. I made a promise to myself that when I die in six months, six years or 60 years, if you helped me live long, hopefully longer, I am gonna ask myself one question. And this is how I would judge my life. And that question is, did I earn my gift? And I was giving the ultimate gift because we
Starting point is 00:36:57
in our evolution can process death. Otherwise, we would have never left the cave. I left the cave. Otherwise, we would have never left the cave. I left the cave. I was giving the gift. And that gift is a responsibility, not a gift. Who do you think was the first person around you to see that difference? I mean, I have to guess your wife must have just because of her proximity to you
Starting point is 00:37:19
and how close the two of you are. What do you think she noticed first? Once the dust settled, meaning the months that followed. how close the two of you are, what do you think she noticed first? Once the dust settled, meaning the months that followed. Now think about the clarity of not postponing anything, not dealing with negative energy and focusing on what matters. So my three thoughts at the plane was landing of no regrets. I try to live a life of no regrets.
Starting point is 00:37:45
And by no means is perfect. But if I was to, I don't know, index the amount of negative moments I've had with my wife, I bet you they're under 10% of what they used to be. I has for forgiveness not because I may have done something wrong, but because someone was offended by what I did, I choose to be happy, not righteous. I wanna sort of focus on that a little bit
Starting point is 00:38:07
because even just if nobody listening to this can relate to that, I still want the benefit, but I suspect I'm not alone. When I was a kid, actually in high school, and I was a struggling high school student, and I showed, I wouldn't say I showed no potential, but it was certainly not clear what I was supposed to be when I grew up, all I wanted to be was a professional boxer, but they made me take this aptitude test.
Starting point is 00:38:29
And it was not about sort of academic aptitude, but more of emotional like where would you fit? And I remember the result of the test was the strongest signal they had ever seen for someone who values justice and things to be in correct order. And they were like, well, you've probably got a career in law enforcement ahead of you son. You know, you really ought to consider joining the police force or maybe you end up going to law school and you'll become a judge. But you really have this strong arc of justice. You just want justice. And I think that that's sort of a detriment sometimes.
Starting point is 00:39:08
I think it's, because you do, you get into these arguments with your spouse. And even if you're gonna be objective, in some situations they're wrong and you're right, but you're right, this idea that what is the upside to that? You could very easily just drop this case, quote unquote, and get back to just being a happy existence with the world.
Starting point is 00:39:28
So were you someone who would argue a point if you felt you were right? Because I've never known that side of you, it's so hard for me to imagine you having any of that streak in you that I have, for example. Yeah, I'm lying. I'm heart-headed. I'm heart-headed. I would less than that, I would be too passionate about certain You know, heart-headed. Like, little, yeah, I would less than that. I would be too passionate about certain things.
Starting point is 00:39:47
But think about it. There's always three sides to an argument. Yours, theirs, and the truth. And if you start every argument understanding that you don't have the truth, you have your truth. It's really easy to surrender to that. And most things in life are a shade of gray and not completely black
Starting point is 00:40:06
and white. And the problem is when we believe we're right, we have made something black and white. Do you think that that is something you knew beforehand and choose to ignore or is it something that you somehow came to you as an epiphany as a result of this? This is my mom's teachings, but I ignore them until. You ignore them, yeah. My favorite, I plagiarized most of the things I said in being put a weekend and learning English when I came to college here.
Starting point is 00:40:34
I literally, I'm constantly collecting new thoughts from others. I had an original thought after the plane crash, like mine. I could literally claim this set of words, may have been utter but I've never heard them and it is that I collect bad wines. You know now I plagiarize that from you. Oh good. Yeah finally. Tell us why you do that because I love it. I collect bad wines is the trigger thought for not postponing anything. And the thought is, if you go to my house, I have a lot of bad wine,
Starting point is 00:41:07
because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening my best one. This changes in an instant. I don't want to leave with a bunch of good wine that I'll never drink. And it's a way of living. It's a way of living in everything. So collecting bad wines means so much.
Starting point is 00:41:23
It just means taking the trip, making the call, taking the risk, having the courage, forcing yourself to things that you know you need to do. I know you know this, but I was 45 pounds heavier at the time when this happened. And this was a commitment of me saying I'm doing all of this. It becomes very centering. Which by the way, a little counterintuitive, some would argue, good thing you had those two ice creams, like wouldn't you have regretted it if that planes crashing and you're like, man, I just wanted those two ice creams.
Starting point is 00:41:55
You can take these things to two different extremes and there is a bit of a contrast which is on the one hand, you're living for the moment in which case we should be as hedonic as possible. But at the other hand, you've lost 45 pounds, you were healthy to begin with, but you're you're living for the moment, in which case, we should be as hedonic as possible. But at the other hand, you've lost 45 pounds, you were healthy to begin with, but you're much healthier today. You're probably 10 years younger physiologically, which is a very forward looking point. How do you reconcile those completely at odds, behaviors, or behaviors is the wrong word, but viewpoints? I still have the ice cream. I think again it's an notion of balance. I think it's defining the game. Is your game longer or shorter today?
Starting point is 00:42:32
So there's a book that it's coming out called the Infinite Game and I believe in the Infinite Game before the book Simon Sennick and his great is a friend and he wrote this book. It's very much a philosophy which I live life which is the whole purpose of the game is to play the next game. There's no winning. There's no outcome. There's no end. So because I play the infinite game in life, I want to be healthy enough to continue to play the game. I can win the game of complete pleasure for a day and month of year, but then I lose my ability to keep playing the game. It's called the Infinite Game, it's phenomenal.
Starting point is 00:43:11
Yeah, I've heard him speak about it, but I'm looking forward to it very much. I wanna go back to sort of the winter and spring of 2009. You did mention in your TED talk that, I don't know if it was weeks later or some period later, you're at a recital for your daughter. Tell me about that. Do you ever watch a movie Ghost?
Starting point is 00:43:29
That's the Bruce Willis or... No, Patrick's Ways, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, many, many years. Many years. And there's a scene in that movie where he's dead and he's the ghost and he's watching. He's seen life as it's happening and I felt like I was sitting there and he was probably two weeks later,
Starting point is 00:43:45
something's a very recent and I felt like I was the ghost. Like I was not supposed to be there. And here I'm watching my daughter and just completely bawling and people around me, I'm like, this is supposed to be a happy play dude. And I was bawling because I was giving that gift of seeing her on that stage. And by the way, it doesn't have to be a stage, it doesn't have to be a play. The magic of seeing your kids every day grow up, if you want to choose to see it that way, can be equally powerful. So it was a moment where I realized, wow, this is the gift is to be able to watch my kids grow up and it was centering around that of all my priorities is my most important one. How did your travel schedule and your
Starting point is 00:44:39
relationship with work change as a result of this? Was that a quick change? Was it a gradual change? I remember you sat me down six years ago and showed me your calendar and we walked through sort of the way you ran things. Tell me a little bit more about that today. Time is our only currency. It's the only thing that matters. In our civilization, we saw for wealth first, but find any really rich person that is old or sick, and they'll trade it all for more time. Right, so. It's worth pausing on that for a moment, because most people listening to this think, sure, sure, sure, yeah, yeah, that's easy to say. But I've asked the following question to probably 50 patients, and more than 100 people, I'm sure. And the answer is always the same, which is to ask someone who's at the age of 40, 50,
Starting point is 00:45:30
60, would you trade places with someone who's 90 years old in exchange for a trillion dollars? And everybody thinks about it for a second and goes, well, no, I actually do the math. I said, well, take your age now, subtract it from the age of 90. Take that delta divided by the trillion. You're telling me that you value time more than this. You could actually make a calculation
Starting point is 00:45:56
and it's telling you how valuable time is to you when phrase that, and most people don't appreciate that. I certainly at times fail to appreciate just how much of a premium I truly place on time. And yet, even today before we started this podcast, I was lamenting the fact that I agreed to take a call as a favor to somebody and it ate into an hour of my day and I was sort of like, sometimes I just don't say no enough
Starting point is 00:46:20
and I don't protect time enough. And yet if I did that calculation more, I would. So how did you calculate that? And how did you implement it? I'll tell you. But you remind me of one of my favorite stories. And I tell this story to kids. I go speak in a lot of middle schools,
Starting point is 00:46:34
and I just were younger kids. And they're all cut up in all this material stuff. And I say, OK, I'm going to give you a million dollars, but you have to give me your arms. And all the kids, oh, no, no, no. I'm going to give you a million dollars, but you have to give me your arms. And all the kids, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna give you five million dollars, you're gonna give me your arms and your legs. No, no, no, no.
Starting point is 00:46:51
Okay, I'll give you 10 million dollars, three million dollars, your arms, your legs, and your eyes. And the value of the story is you're ready rich, because you have your health. Money really can't buy that. So value, how lucky you are. The talk is around the power of luck. And most of the things that show up as unlucky things end up being lucky things in life, if you choose to see them that way. And so you just reminded me of that story. So listen,
Starting point is 00:47:17
I waste no time. I waste no time. I only do things that I find that are aligned to what I want to, what I'm prioritizing or that I enjoy a lot or that put me in a path forward of what I want. And as a result, I am really comfortable saying no all the time. I'm very thoughtful and polite. I don't join any outside boards. I have demoted friends that I grew so that I can make room for new friends. I travel light, I travel light through light because I need to figure out a way
Starting point is 00:47:48
to increase the value of my time. I have an amazing chief of staff who solves for 40% of the stuff that I shouldn't be doing and all that stuff. So I put enough structure around me that I can be really efficient with my time, but it's really finding always more ways to do it. But saying no is everything.
Starting point is 00:48:06
How do you say no? First of all, if someone says, hey, would you come speak at this event? My answer is pretty standard. I'm honored that you would ask. I'm humble that you would ask. Right now, my priorities are my family and growing our company.
Starting point is 00:48:21
And as it is, I don't have enough time. Eventually, I hope to have time to do things like this. And if you would have me, I would love to do it. Does it feel bad to say no? Oh no. Because when you're saying yes, you're saying no to something else. So everything in life has a price.
Starting point is 00:48:39
You know, so funny. I interviewed a good friend of mine, Jason Fried, and he said the exact same thing, which is such a beautiful way to think about it, is every time you say yes, you're actually saying no to a good friend of mine, Jason Fried, and he said the exact same thing, which is such a beautiful way to think about it, is every time you say yes, you're actually saying no to a number of things that you can't anticipate between now and then. It's easy to say, I'll do you want A or B. It's hard to say, you want A or door number being you don't know what it is, and most times we don't know.
Starting point is 00:48:57
Opportunity cost is really, it's by the way, one of the keys to business is not settling for good and waiting for great. How many days a month do you think you traveled prior to 2009? I went and tracked it. I was probably on the road 15 nights. 15. And what is it today? That's not vacation with my family?
Starting point is 00:49:19
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm away from family. Four? Wow. And it's literally decreased like one per year. And I track it. I track now too, thanks to yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm away from family. Four? Wow. And it's literally decreased like one per year. And I track it. I track now, too, thanks to you. Good.
Starting point is 00:49:29
This is the first year I'm gonna break, but meaning I'll be less than 10 days a month away from family. I'll average through December 31st. I'll hit 9.9. Wonderful. I want eight next year. That's the way to go.
Starting point is 00:49:42
We focus on what we measure. It's just our brains are distance. That's what they say. It's a dream until you write it down and then it's a goal. The same thing. It's the same principle. Do you think your kids at the time knew what happened? Yeah. There was sort of six and seven, right? Yeah. They kind of understood that something really big had happened, but it really impact them. My son just did a project of his identity in life and one of the central story was this story. I don't know, and he's 18. So it tells you how hopefully he gave him context of enjoying life. You said something earlier that I just thought was so incredible and I can't stop thinking about it. This idea that Sully basically said,
Starting point is 00:50:25
you are only a pilot when you lose an engine. Like everything you've done is sort of preparation for that one defining moment of your life. Have you thought about ways that that extrapolates to what it means to be a father, what it means to be a husband, what it means to be a CEO? What are the equivalents of the engine losing moment when the rubber hits the road and all that other stuff is just
Starting point is 00:50:51
there to prepare you for that moment. The easy answer on the business side is you're only a leader in a moment of crisis. Otherwise you're just in charge. So and you as a leader have to prepare yourself for the moment of crisis. And it's going to come. And unfortunately, because economically, we've been such a big nine, 10 year period, there's a lot of people that don't have the temperament to deal with what's coming. Maybe in a year, maybe in three, maybe next month, it doesn't, it's coming.
Starting point is 00:51:21
There's going to be a year. So that's the easier one is bringing your organization along to understand that when things change, we're going to have to lead and doing fire drills around it and doing scenario planning around, okay, what happens if we have a date of reach, what happens if we have business issue, what happen, like all those things we do not constantly, but we do it them enough to create consciousness about it. And then time will tell, come in the crisis gum, are you going to be able to it. And then time will tell, when the crisis comes, are you gonna be able to lead or not? I find that interesting when people call themselves leaders
Starting point is 00:51:50
and they've never done anything in a time of crisis. I'm like, oh, you're in charge. I'm not sure you're a leader yet. I think with kids, we like many other families have had to deal with our share of experiences with teenagers that are very, very hard and our kids are in a good path and they're going to be great, but it hasn't been easy at all and has been really
Starting point is 00:52:11
in-branded and I talk about it a lot. Not only has it united us even stronger to help our kids through their situations, but it is, I've learned more about myself through being a dad, because hard driving people like you and I think we know. And what you realize that your key of being a father or mother is to find their gift and then to help them get to their gift and accept them for their strengths and their weaknesses. And the last thing you want a kid to feel ashamed.
Starting point is 00:52:42
And when we want something different for our kids, then what they seem to want, there's a high chance you end up shaming them without wanting to or gilting them. So I think for a parent to lead is to meet the kid where they are and finding their natural bent and encouraging it and making them their various version of themselves. And that was not apparent to me when I signed up for this. This has been with two teenagers that are super gifted and super kind, but they are teenagers. And there you have to deal with a lot of stuff. You and I didn't have to deal. It's not easy. I'm dreading every second of it truthfully, because I do think kids today live in a world.
Starting point is 00:53:25
Maybe every parent says that. Maybe my parents felt the same way. I who knows, but I think it's, I think it looks brutal to be a teenager today. Maybe what I'm telling you is that you're going to have to grow up a lot to be able to do that. Well, that's what we've seeked a lot of help and it's been great. And we have dug in and we've done a lot of research and we tried a lot of things I haven't worked and it's a real commitment in by the way, we're not out of the woods yet. It's a It's what I mean, I'm just gonna get incredibly selfish for a moment and just ask for some advice
Starting point is 00:53:58
So how do you handle things like electronics and social media like what have you learned and this doesn't necessarily have to be at the Expensive your own relationship with your kids, but even from other parents. Again, you have a company of thousands of employees. You have a purview into the lives of more than just your own. What advice do you give parents who are trying to think through those issues?
Starting point is 00:54:18
I'll tell you in anecdote. So last week, my daughter's school had a trip to Disneyland. And my daughter is one of the few kids in her class that does not have a smartphone or a cell phone at all. So most of the kids do. And they're driving up and it's my wife and another mom that are driving up in sort of the minivan and there's the four kids are in the back.
Starting point is 00:54:35
And three of them have a phone. And my daughter gets my wife's phone and they're playing with it. And my wife looks back and she says all four of them are glued to the phones. They're not talking. They're not interacting at all. It's like a road trip. four of them are glued to the phones. They're not talking. They're not interacting at all. It's like a road trip and they're all glued to these phones. So she says, hey guys, let's put the phones away and you guys got to do something. You got to talk, you got to play a game, you got to, whatever.
Starting point is 00:54:55
Okay, well, extract that moment for a second and you realize there is a lot of stuff that they're missing and you could argue, look, maybe they're getting things we didn't get that were better for them. Who knows? But to see the lack of basic socialization concerns me, how do you or what advice do you have to navigate that? I don't have better advice than others. I think kids should be kids.
Starting point is 00:55:18
Meaning parents should decide what are the controls. You don't give kid a remote to the TV and say to whatever you want. I think my mom said, which I love raising teenagers is a tug of war you ultimately must lose. Because that's how they become adults. So there has to be enough tension. You can't lose at 13. It's at 19 they have, but you have to be losing incrementally. Yeah. You can't be winning and then lose. So it's a tug of war that you're the resistance So you also have to think about it kids specific every kid is different age specific
Starting point is 00:55:50
But you also don't want them to be the misfit. You don't so don't want them to be missing out and we kind of tend to project our Reality into others. They're gonna live in a world where Your kids are probably never gonna drive your kids to live with, probably not even a cell phone. They're going to see screens in their glasses. They're going to do all the stuff that you can't even understand. They're going to live in a mix of a VR world and a real world. You want your kid to be able to be successful, happy, subtle, whatever it is your goal in that world, not in 1982 of the VHS.
Starting point is 00:56:25
So you also got to remind yourself that this is a, you can't hold on to the past so much. I can't. And you know, I find very interesting. I have this conversation with lots of friends. If you ask anybody, what is your goal for your kid? They'll tell you some version of the same thing. Happy, well adjusted, contributing, growing, finding their passion, whatever BS will talk to you. And we mean it.
Starting point is 00:56:46
But then you watch the way we raise kids is over schedule, two sports, a trainer, a this, that another coach, pre SAT, pre SAT, pre this, take it six times, that that really help. The stressing kids out to that extent, they're like, oh, why are they so stressed? Well, we're making them super stressed. This culture is stressful enough, and I think as parents, we judge so much of our own self esteem by what others think about our kids
Starting point is 00:57:13
that we fail to understand. What really is our goal? If you really want your kid to be happy, adjusted, whatever, you would do a lot of things differently. So back to your question of, just remind yourself, what is it that you're trying to do and try to align to them? It's a great point you make about, So back to your question, just remind yourself what is it that you're trying to do and try to align to that. It's a great point you make about, you know, I was telling you a story before we started about my son and
Starting point is 00:57:32
that moment I had in that experience where I realized, man, how is it that I've let my ego become tied up in his behavior? How is it that how he behaves in public as a five-year-old and when he has a temper tantrum, I somehow internalize that as people are looking at me as a bad parent. I mean, it feels so silly to even say that out loud, but I don't think I'm the first person that's felt that. And that gets carried forward. I think that is such a big part of the over scheduling, overdoing it.
Starting point is 00:58:02
It's hard. We make so many mistakes ourselves, and we look at each other and I'm like, what are we doing? Like, it's a long race. I do believe, I think it was outliers or whatever it been. I do believe that the more you make kids feel comfortable and successful and the race they're on, we judge ourselves against our relative set. So put kids in situations that they feel like they are progressing and they'll find whatever their ceiling is in a long enough time. So many kids quit sports because we push them too hard too early. And they're like, this doesn't feel good. This has produced no endorphins at all
Starting point is 00:58:36
in the contrary, right? So I think a lot of the issues with kids in the day, just the parents, not the kids. And we wanna blame electronic, and all the stuff that are issues. But the issue is really that I don't think where that honest has parents in terms of our goals and our actions. Why do you think that has changed in a generation? I mean, you've spoken a little bit about your parents
Starting point is 00:58:59
and it's kind of amazing, right? So they seem to be wise beyond their years. Your mom's comment about the tug of war that has to slowly be lost is honestly one of the most insightful things I've ever heard about parenting, where your parents as educated as you are. I was born in a Latin family, and my dad is an amazing guy, but my mom raised us four kids and six years, and I think that the definition of one's life success is where do you come from and where did you end? Did you help advance the cost of our race,
Starting point is 00:59:31
the human race, and you do that through your family first? And if you're lucky enough, through your community, if you're lucky enough in a broader way like you who are impacting a broader set of people. But I think the ultimately goal of life is to make it better for others, starting with your kids. And I think my mom is the most successful person I know because of what she was giving, versus what she gave us.
Starting point is 00:59:51
How old were you guys when you left Puerto Rico? I came to the U.S. to go to college. So I came to Boston College in January 1999. So your family stayed? Yeah, born and raised. Yeah, okay. What was that like to show up in Boston at 18 or whatever you were? Ignorance is a wonderful bliss. If I knew what I would have never come, I really
Starting point is 01:00:14
think that ignorance is a bliss. I shut up as a second semester freshman because it was the year after Doug Flutey and there were no dorms and my parents are like we're not paying for an apartment, so I came as a second semester freshman and they put me in a plane they gave me 200 bucks my dad said go be a man and I got on a plane I didn't even know how to go to the gate by myself travel a few times I put a Rico and what I realized as soon as I got to Boston is I didn't really understand English and I was ill-equipped to go to college but overcoming that was the greatest gift. Why did you go so far into such a cold place? Why didn't you go to school in Florida, for example? Or... I don't know. My uncle said Boston is great. So I said Boston is great. Duck Flutey said
Starting point is 01:00:54
I was racing at Catholic school so Boston College was Catholic. So I just I landed and I'm like what in the world is this? And I ended up in the freshman year. You said second semester. So it's winter when you showed it. And I showed up five days freshman camp. You said second semester. So it's winter when you showed it. And I shut up five days before anybody. And at 200 bucks, and that's lots of stories of like completely embarrassing things that happen as I went through this. And because I was ill equipped, I was a misfit
Starting point is 01:01:17
in every regard. And I never face racism, which I did at the time. I faced all sorts of things that I'm glad I did. Because it made me a lot more aware of what other people go through. What had your parents or your mom even specifically done to prepare you for that moment? Topped me independence, topped me that where are you in the birth order of the three out of four?
Starting point is 01:01:36
Did the two above you leave Puerto Rico for college? My brother, one above is in Kansas City as a doctor and my sister went and then came back after a couple years. Did you talk to them about it before you left? Technically my brother wrote my essays. I think I gave him something in spangulation and he wrote them and I got in. Hopefully, they won't take my degree away. If so, we'll find somebody to give you an honorary one instead.
Starting point is 01:02:05
Tell me about the remainder of those three and a half years though. Obviously, it sets you on a good path and you decided to stay. I came here wanting to go back to Puerto Rico and halfway through and I love this country. I love what this is about. I work at Fenway Park, it's a security guard. I drove a limo in the summers. I was hustling, making money, my dad said, I'll pay a third, you get loans for a third, and I had an academic scholarship for a third, but you're responsible for your own money.
Starting point is 01:02:29
So it was the greatest thing yet. I don't know why I wouldn't do that to my kids, because it's very different. Do you think about that? Do you think about your story of coming here as an immigrant having nothing is a story that many people can relate to? And because of your success, your kids
Starting point is 01:02:45
have a privilege that you've never had. How do you think about imparting on them some of the, I don't know, lessons is the right word or internal fortitude or whatever, call it what you want to call it. How do you think about that? I actually think about it almost the inverse of what you said. I think it's really hard to be our kids. I think we're giving them not privilege. We're giving them a big big crust to carry and I feel a lot of responsibility for not bearing so much of a shadow that my kids can't find their own son and
Starting point is 01:03:21
We travel we travel in certain ways and whatever. What are you setting our kids up? I think it's really hard. It's a lot easier to grow up the way I did, which I can do better. I think it's harder and you have to set up a different game. You have to set up a game that they feel they can win and you have to get them thinking about the infinite game of there's no end here. That's why so many of them end up in drugs and end up in other things because they say that's not something I can be successful at. First of all, I actually think you're correct. I think both of the statements are correct. So
Starting point is 01:03:52
it's harder and easier and that the hardness and easiness pay off are actually co-existing and creating that dynamic. So you can't dim your own light, I mean, as you said, especially someone like you who's been kind of given this gift. We haven't even got to talking about red ventures, which I want to in a minute. You can't not be Rick Elias. So, how can they be your kids? I think, first of all, it's not what you say, it's what you do. I work really, really hard.
Starting point is 01:04:20
I want them to understand that working hard is part of the way you achieve things in life. To me, I don't have any issues with that and as long as it's protecting our family time and what matters to us. I think, secondly, is how you treat other people. The best thing that you can do to teach your kids how to live is to treat strangers with kindness. They're watching your every action. They're watching and by the way, you are a teacher all the time and not with your words because they won't hear you but with your actions. So every time you find yourself which we all do, getting upset about something with a driver or a waitress because something was cold or a manager because they made you wait and you
Starting point is 01:05:05
get a little righteous which we all do. You're doing the opposite. You're teaching them a behavior that is not going to help them. So I view our responsibility. The best thing I can do is model hard work, model giving and kindness, model good energy to other people, respect. We're looking to know a lot of people that others will consider super famous and I treat them exactly the same way that a stranger that is doing whatever job. And they see that. So those are the things, the only things you can do. You can't apologize for your success and you can't run away from it, but you have to talk to them about, not, hey, I want you to get into an Ivy League school and I want you to do all this stuff. I want you I want you to get into a nightly league school and I want you to do all this stuff I you know, I want you to
Starting point is 01:05:45
Find your gift and I want you to figure out a way to give that gift to others again That's a I think that's so well said. It's hard and I'm this is not a perfect journey. I wear full of flaws in it Were you ever a person that struggled to apologize before 2009 and if so is it easier for you to apologize today? It was very hard. I'm very proud I apologize before 2009, and if so, is it easier for you to apologize today? It was very hard. I'm very proud. I'm very competitive. And those two things, and I can rationalize
Starting point is 01:06:10
anything as to why I was right. You know what, Peter, I apologize for things. I don't even know what I did, because I don't give a shit. If it's creating negative energy, I can really easily say, listen, I am really sorry, I offended you. It was not my intent. That's it. What won? And I don't seek to understand and argue the kind of argument. and they say, listen, I am really sorry, I offended you. It was not my intent. That's it. Move on.
Starting point is 01:06:25
And I don't seek to understand and argue the kind of argument. I was like, does this really matter? Am I going to remember it in six months? Is it going to change anything? Just move on. It's like a leakage of energy. And when you leak energy, it consumes time. And that's your only currency.
Starting point is 01:06:41
Imagine if you were like, your toilet was running of $100 build non-stop. Like that's divisual. That's what a silly fight is. You know, you probably have the longest list of anybody I know of things that don't matter. What is on your list of things that do matter? What is worth fighting for?
Starting point is 01:06:58
What is worth being upset about? Those are two different questions. So that's why my pause, things that matter and things worth being upset about. I think injustice is worth being upset about. Those are two different questions. So that's why my pause, things that matter and things worth being upset about. I think injustice is worth being upset about. And obviously based on everything you've said, it's not about your own injustice. When the Uber driver doesn't show up and when the waitress spills your soup, that's not injustice. It's, as you know, I'm attracted to places where this system fails.
Starting point is 01:07:21
People that can't help themselves, that want to help themselves. That's kind of our sweet spot and all our social impact work. Let's talk a little bit about that actually. where the system fails, people that can help themselves, that want to help themselves. That's kind of our sweet spot. And while our social impact work, let's talk a little bit about that actually. I think too much is given, much is expected. And I think the best way to do any type of social impact work is using your platform, not just using your wallet,
Starting point is 01:07:40
if you can. And so here I am. I have a thriving company with a lot of young people that are exceptional. How do I put them to do something that matters to them, which is give back, thickens our culture, but also allows us to do something that gives us our real purpose, which is leaving our wood pile higher than we found it. That's what we talk about as a company. That's the only purpose of the company. We're not going to go public. We're not going to sell. This is the infinite game. Someday, you'll go to zero. Hopefully someone else is running it. This is a way that we spend our energy together, the people we work with and the problems we solve
Starting point is 01:08:13
and all of that. So when you put it in that context of none of this really ultimately matters other than advancing the game, I am attracted to injustices where the system is not working. An example will be on documented kids. They're known as DACA now in the Supreme Court is here in the case and these are kids that were brought here without two years old four-year-old six-year-old illegally. The parents brought them here illegally. But we don't check education for primary school, secondary school, or high school. So many of these kids don't even know Spanish or whatever the language is. They never really remember being in their country. And by the time they get to 18, we said, sorry, you can't go to college.
Starting point is 01:08:52
There's no federal financial aid because they're not citizens. And then there is no in-state tuition in about 26 states. So their chances are going to college are basically zero. And I'm not talking there's like thousands of these. There was about a million of these in 2010. Kids that were zero to 18 that were investing all this money. So even if you want to take the Republican side of this, which is a valid argument,
Starting point is 01:09:14
there are going to be a lot more productive if you educate them. That's the whole reason to do this. So don't play a lot more taxes. So DACA is Obama-Passus is executive order where he says, okay, if you graduate college and you are undocumented and you're within this age, you can get a work permit.
Starting point is 01:09:29
So now going to college makes sense because you used to be that you got an education that was no way to get a job. And that's what's getting debated right now. There's like 600,000 of these kids with work permits. We have about, I don't know, probably 50 of them working at Red Ventures right now.
Starting point is 01:09:46
So what I did is- How many? 50. But we have 300 plus going through college that we're supporting. So Golden Dores College got launched. We did our first class of 12, then 17, then 25, then 30. We're now reviewing applicants for the next class. And this is the first time we're using N-doc. I said, if you're undocumented,
Starting point is 01:10:06
we're gonna take a stance for you. And if you deserve to go to college, you are gonna go our top 200 candidates, Peter. 3.91, unweighted GPA. Unweighted. Think about the waste of talent. None of those kids are going to college. Tell me what happens to those kids
Starting point is 01:10:21
if they don't go to college. They end up working in a fast-foot place or just waste time. Waste a ton. Many times they didn't even find a job because they never go back to the country that they were born in. That's the problem. They don't feel culturally assimilated. They're American.
Starting point is 01:10:35
A lot of them don't find out that they're undocumented until they go take a driver's license or something. They're like, you can't. It's very, very cruel for these kids. And they're your kids, friends. And they're as American as our kids are. I find those kids did not come in a crime. Those kids did not have a choice to move here at two years old.
Starting point is 01:10:53
Those kids have done everything we've asked them with the system. What is this country all about? Isn't this the country where if you want to put in the work, we give you a chance. And so I find that to be a place that we put a lot of energy towards 18 to 24. There's about five and a half million young adults in the US. This are not undocumented. This are citizens. Out of school or out of work, terminally, under employed, five and a half million. And I think companies can do a lot more for them. So we set up a five or
Starting point is 01:11:22
one, say three, call road to higher where we're training these kids and coding, in tech, back tech, and all the stuff. And we're now opening the platform for the company, so B.O.V. and Novant, and other companies in Charlotte are literally hiring these kids. We train them as an adulting school for six months and we pay them to adult them.
Starting point is 01:11:40
We train them skills, and then we put them in a two-year apprenticeship program. And we hold our hands for two years We have another program called life sports Eighth graders in Title One schools in Charlotte are two years behind Unreading Charlotte is probably no different than other places title one schools is assisted lunch and Our belief is that hope has an expiration date and that expiration date educationly comes about that age. And sports is a universal language.
Starting point is 01:12:07
So we have basketball, soccer, girls basketball, where we bring this kit in out of the worst schools every day. We give them, usually their last meal of the day, we give them an hour worth of reading because we think if they can catch up with reading, they'll extend their hope. And then we give them an hour and a half worth of exercise every weekend.
Starting point is 01:12:26
There's activities. We have 250 kids now in the program. We started it two and a half years ago. We're going to grow. We're going to be alone. So we're just trying to do our part like as our drops in the water, but they matter. And then for me, matter after Hurricane Maria, that I did something for Puerto Rico. So we launch seven eight forward seven eight seven.
Starting point is 01:12:42
That's the area code. So we're training right now. We're training about 8, 7. That's the area of code. So we're training. Right now we're training about 70 young Puerto Ricans in the US that we want to reverse the brain drain. So we're going to bring them back. We're giving them real digital jobs. And we're going to move businesses to Puerto Rico so that we can bring people back to Puerto Rico. I want to go back to the first of those because you're not a dogmatic guy, you're not a self-righteous guy, you're a very empathetic person. Help me see my blind spot, which is like you, well, no, no, you're one of me. I'm first generation, so my parents came to the country with the $100 in the pocket sort of thing, worked like crazy, and now we get to live this better life.
Starting point is 01:13:23
And because I saw a lot of that, I never really understood the sentiment against immigration. Now part of that is because I grew up in Canada. So Canada, very different from the United States, on many levels. If you were to try to explain from the standpoint of empathy,
Starting point is 01:13:39
what do you think is the view that sort of opposes immigration or opposes immigration reform. Because even though you're very clearly on this side, you strike me as someone who can also see the other person's viewpoint. I think immigration is one of the hardest issues for us to contend because philosophically, this is a country of immigrants. Practically, this is a country that has lots of issues with its own people. So this is not an easy answer that you say, okay, here's the solution to immigration and anything that we as a country decide as a policy will have pros and cons. So I don't tend to profess that we need to have immigration and we need to have
Starting point is 01:14:19
immigration reform and we need to have better controls and we need to figure out what we do with 10 million immigrants. By the way, if we take all the illegal immigrants out of this country, we will not function because so many jobs that get done today that you and I rely directly and indirectly. No one wants to do. Our unemployment rate is sub 4%. So it's not like we have 18% unemployment rate and a line of people who want to do this jobs and immigrants are doing them for half the money No, there's no people that are sitting waiting to do a job and this job's no one wants to do Right, so I think this we underestimate but it's a real issue and I think we have to deal with
Starting point is 01:14:59
Those 10 million people I think kids should be dealt with Separately, this are the DACA kids and by way, both Republicans and Democrats agree on the undocumented kids, but they don't want to give it up because then you give up all immigration issue. Meaning it's the thin end of the wedge towards the slippery slope of this. Right. And so that's what the argument has been. Well, I'll give you that. But if we do this, and I don't know if the answer is a wall or no wall, I'm not educated enough. We need controls. We need smart immigration. We need, you know, the fact that we have all this PhDs that we're educating at Stanford and all this places and then we're sending them
Starting point is 01:15:33
back when they want to stay here. That doesn't make sense, right? But it's not an easy answer. And there's a really good argument to say, listen, we can't take our resources and you open up the gate with Mexico and you have tens of millions of people from Central America and all that coming in. We don't have our house in order enough to be able to absorb that as much of a humanitarian as you want to be. But there should be a thoughtful way that we allow different types of people to come in.
Starting point is 01:15:59
Some decisions could be very easy, which is any PhD out of our system. Some can be very humanitarian. We're going to bring in this amount of people. Some of them can be very thoughtful in terms of skills, but everything I get, I don't know enough, but there can be a lot around work permits. Like the problem here is that it's an underground. It's an underworld. If you brought it above board and, you know, about five years ago, maybe six
Starting point is 01:16:23
years ago, I visited you, that red ventures and I got to spend a full day watching something you call the business review. I don't know why I came for that, but I knew I was really looking forward to it. We must have been speaking about the way you manage teams. I think it just interested the heck out of me. And I was like, can I come and spend a day watching? And you were like, of course, we'd be honored to have you. I'll preface this by saying, I don't have a degree in business. You went to Harvard, you have an MBA. But I was around a lot of Harvard MBAs and Stanford MBAs and stuff because I worked at McKinsey.
Starting point is 01:16:57
So I know, I mean, I've been around the block. I can talk the talk a little bit. And I mean, at least no enough to recognize when people know what they're talking about. I have never seen anything like I saw that day, Rick. Your ability to process information, to multitask, to make decisions, to sift through what was not relevant, and to always be asking the jugular question in the setting and context of more information than could be processed by any person blew my mind. And to this day, more than five years later, I still talk about that day constantly. And when I ran into Dan, your partner, your co-founder, a few months ago, it was the first
Starting point is 01:17:41
thing I asked him about. How are the business reviews? Can you explain to people listening how this idea came about? Because I suspect that anybody who leads a team in any domain will find this to be illuminating. Yeah, first I am humbled by your words. I'm not really sure that I buy all of that. I think that I heard a quote that I love in life. There's two kinds of people. I heard it recently from a good that I love in life. There's two kinds of people.
Starting point is 01:18:05
I heard it recently from a good friend of mine. The humble and those that are about to be humbles. I think our journey was such a struggle for the first four years. I don't know if you remember, we raised two million dollars in Biden November. We had no revenues and a hundred grand left. And it took us three years to get back to zero. So when you taste your own blood for a long enough period of time, you realize that a lot of this is you got to fight the fight and you got to stay with it and you have to stay hungry and a lot of this for me is avoiding complacency and all the things that end up killing most organizations. So really you had two deaths. Probably that's true. You basically tasted death on January 15th, 2009, and you
Starting point is 01:18:47
tasted death a few years earlier than that from a business perspective. Yeah, and for me, I gave my work to my friends that I was going to do all I could, and I wanted to go to my reunions. I decided I'm going to hustle and we hustle and we, and by the way, I am so glad. Like, it's such a rich part of who we are, the humility that you see in our building. We have this beautiful campus, but I see car payment. People see success and stuff. So the business reviews have evolved and continue to evolve.
Starting point is 01:19:16
One of our basic, and you know that, I don't. Maybe tell folks for a moment what Red Ventures does. Even though I don't think that's relevant to the story, I think if you were running any business, we'd be the same way, but just give people a bit of context. So it's changed twice since you were there, but today we are a significant network of digital assets that all have deep integrations
Starting point is 01:19:34
into the different service providers. So we are trying to aggregate lots of services that consumer buys by owning assets like the point sky or bank rate of all connect or health lines So we have about 130 million unique every month into our network of assets and then we do very deep integrations with all the services providers all the card issuers all the banks everybody in health care and Basically trying to change the consumer experience digitally. That's a very different business then we were when you were there kind of five years ago I don't know if you remember, but I don't believe that business should be run with values.
Starting point is 01:20:09
And I had this really interesting debate with Meg Whitman at the same event we were at. I didn't get to watch this. Yeah, and she's a much more accomplished CEO than it will ever be and all of that. And we were talking about culture and she said, hey, it's all about your values. And then they asked me and I said, to me, values is a noun. And I don't know how to run a business with nouns. I know how to run them with verbs. So we have a set of belief statements. By the way, we're not right. Just the way that we choose to use the word, but we have a series of belief statements that anchor our culture.
Starting point is 01:20:38
And in the middle of that belief statement, the core one in the middle is everything is written and pencil. It's a wonderful belief statement because it helps us recruit. If you're somebody who wants certainty, you want all the stuff, you're never going to fit in, it allows us to evolve and change our mind because the world is changing so fast that we're not anchored. And then it really gives us permission to experiment because everything is written in pencil. The last one is we believe that are leaving the wood power than we found it is our purpose. So that's the... Give us some of the others. The first one is we believe in running up the escalators. So that means that business have to play with pace. This is not about speed, speed, speed. This is about pace. The more reps you get,
Starting point is 01:21:19
the more you iterate through problems. And business reviews an example of a place that forces reps. And what that means is how do you organize your organizational design? How do you compensate people? All those things really, really matter. Running a company is really like at an orchestra. There's no right way. There's no perfect song as long as the orchestra is in harmony, where you get in troubles where there's dissonance in the orchestra and you see instruments kind of going their own way. So for us, it's really important that we're playing at a high space. That doesn't mean we work to 7pm every night, but we work hard. We're very purposeful. We're small teams. We're decisive. We're okay. Most things in business are pass fail. Yet we are trained our whole lives for grades.
Starting point is 01:22:02
And I think where a lot of leaders getting trouble is, this is why people have a hard time prioritizing. This is a pass field event. I'll put in 20% of the effort. I just pass. So in the business, really understanding what's pass field and what's grade is, a really important kind of skill.
Starting point is 01:22:17
And you do that when it's pass field, just run up the escalator. So that will be another example. We're great people to work with. We believe that we want to be great people to work with. And I think diversity really matters in a company because you make better decisions. People not only feel accepted, they feel welcome. It is a way that it is important. But I think what diversity does, it lends the opportunity to create inclusion. And if you think about a lot of our social impact work and all of this is about creating inclusion
Starting point is 01:22:44
for people that are not getting access to certain opportunities that we were lucky to have. So, being great to work with is to being very, very much attuned that we all bring something unique to the company and to the table and so forth. But since they're all re-impensal, they're all going to change. So explain how business review works. I know it has changed, by the way, but even the example of the one I saw, not that you could possibly remember that day five years ago or whatever, but you were
Starting point is 01:23:08
basically in a room and you sat at an conference table and there were business leaders basically all presenting to you. And what was the format? How did it work? It's 20 minute meanings. No charts are passed, nothing in color, none of that. A couple of charts on the screen are fine, but you got to be able to get to your point. Right. No big power point decks were being passed out. No. And you have to start the meeting. Okay, here's the problem we're trying to solve, or here's what we're trying to talk about. Like, you have to define your problem. And then you went through it, and then we conclude it with something. So there's many ways to organize meetings. Amazon does it with, you got to write something, I think, as five pages and you come prepared of the meeting, there's no right way of doing anything as long as people understand how
Starting point is 01:23:52
you are going to calibrate work. The pace of this was like nothing I'd ever seen because I remember when I was getting ready to come forward and I wanted to sort of be mindful of what I was about to, so I could, if nothing, participate by asking a question that could be helpful. I remember them saying, okay, so it's, I forget the numbers, 27 meetings. And I was like, well, what do you mean 27 meetings? And they said, they're 20 minutes each. It's a 10 hour day. You know, there's an hour break in there. And we keep it, everybody understands the clock. There is no, you play to the clock. One person would stand up there and explain some problem about, hey, we're doing this deal with AT&T and it's got to look like this and it's got to look like this, but boy, we can't
Starting point is 01:24:32
get this deal done because blah, blah, blah, blah. And you would ask five incredibly pointed questions and I was like, wow, I mean, that's amazing because 10 minutes earlier, you were hearing about something totally unrelated and you could pivot so quickly to this and then you'd exit with a plan, which is okay, great. Here's an idea, you're gonna go back to your counterpart at AT&T. This is gonna be the idea you're gonna pitch,
Starting point is 01:24:54
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, we'll see you in a month. Let me open it window that I think it's an interesting thing. I learned this from a good friend of mine that anything you do in life should be a three-fer, meaning at least a three-fer. Some things can be a for for. And most people are happy to get a two for.
Starting point is 01:25:07
And what I mean is you can do something that has many purposes. The quick example is you're going to go play golf because you play golf. That's a one for if you go play golf at a beautiful course. That's a two for at a beautiful course with your best friends and with great weather. Great. So in business, the business view is a for for us. It's a way to force prioritization. It's a way to train people how to present.
Starting point is 01:25:31
It's a high stakes environment. Your team was so impressive. You're absolutely right about that. I've watched people. I mean, I am a real stickler for having information presented, and it just kills me to watch people who can't get to the point. And there was not one example in 27 meetings of somebody who couldn't get to the point.
Starting point is 01:25:48
I think I strength is there's 2,025 year olds at Red Ventures that have been trained at a level because of all this exercise. That is great. It's the best business school for a lot of these young adults. The third is it forces decision making. A lot of those things were tough decisions. And the worst decision is a no decision. So it forces decision and the fourth is at a culture rates. So it's very much, there were teaching moments, there were things that happened, you shut up with certain things, some things, the acts. So I'd like to set up as an organization, if we're going to invest that kind of energy and time, something that has currency in many different directions. How did you sharpen your sword to get to that point?
Starting point is 01:26:30
Is it literally just the reps? It's reps. Intuition is nothing else than having seen something before. And when you start getting all this pattern recognitions because you've seen so many times the movie and the key is not to see the movie, Peter, I think it's to be introspective about what happened in the movie. So a lot of times I'll finish an negotiation and I'm like, Peter. I think it's to be introspective about what happened in the movie. So a lot of times I'll finish on negotiation and I'm like, I screw that up, I did not read that queue.
Starting point is 01:26:51
I was too aggressive last night. I had a dinner and it was really great. In the last five minutes, I fumbled it. As soon as I got in the calm, like, what did you just do? I don't want to make you talk too much about it, but can you say a little bit more about what it is that you think you fumbled? When you do a lot of interpersonal skills, the other person is talking to you
Starting point is 01:27:08
nonstop without words. And a lot of this is knowing when you stop. In my last two statements, I lost some of the momentum I got with the other 55 minutes, and I just knew it in their eyes. That doesn't matter, right? It's just part of the journey. So my point being is you've got to be super self-awareness is really important in life. Self-management is the key to success. Most people are like, I'm self-aware. Well, can you self-regulate? Can you self-manage? Can you think about all the things you think about and you teach around longevity and nutrition and all that? It's the self-management part of that that matters. I would take it one step further. I mean, I think the self-management part of that that matters. I would take it one step further.
Starting point is 01:27:45
I mean, I think the self-management on the emotional level might be the single most important of them all to manage how you eat and exercise. I think is much easier than to manage your thoughts and your emotions in terms of how you interact with the world. That's not true. Yesterday morning I had a negotiation, someone flew in before I came to New York
Starting point is 01:28:03
and he was a pro and the moment moment he said, down I'm like, oh, this is gonna be a good one. He was a master chess player. So I knew every time they asked something, he wasn't asking something. So you're constantly going, okay, what's the question behind the question? What is it that you're trying to angle?
Starting point is 01:28:16
What is it that you're trying to find? In good negotiation is when you can find currency that they value more than you do, and then you find a way to make it work for everybody When someone is a very good negotiate and they're trying to do that Then you can almost play the inverse game is that can you create an impression of something so that you can create value for something So that you can get something else and then you're reading what they're doing. So it's really fun Do you teach this deliberately to your teams?
Starting point is 01:28:42
Because I got to tell you I don't think that reps alone are sufficient. In other words, you could put me into a hundred deals to negotiate. I don't think I could ever extract the insights that you seem to extract. I think you're doing something at a meta level that few of us do, which is, it's what you said, it's not just seeing the movie. It's knowing what the movie means and knowing how to recreate pieces of the movie in subsequent movies. That's a totally different skill. I don't have it, I know that for a while.
Starting point is 01:29:11
To start by the way, I don't think I'm great at it. I think there's much better people. So this is a journey that there's always someone better than you. So I'm in this constant journey and want to get better. At all this aspect, so the moment you think, I've finished negotiations, discussions were like, oh, there was a prodigate one, it wasn't me. So that was a master's full event. It's happening. You
Starting point is 01:29:34
kind of laugh about when you're so attuned to it, every interaction is a game of influence with your kids, with your spouse, with everything else. And it's not a negotiation. Negotiation means someone wins someone loses. Is constantly trying to influence with your kids, with your spouse, with everything else. And it's not a negotiation. Negotiation means someone wins someone loses. Is you're constantly trying to influence with your thoughts and then you're allowing others people to influence you? What type of person do you run from in business? Negative energy, selfish. What are the telltale signs of that?
Starting point is 01:30:00
Because when that's obvious, those people usually don't even get in the door. What are the subtle signs of that? Like, for us pronouns really matter. We versus I or? Yes, but it's the subtlety on when you say it. Are you taking the credit for things? So you may use the we, but it's all about you, right?
Starting point is 01:30:17
So it's the next level of all of that. So how do you internalize things? I'm looking for people that are really ambitious for something bigger than themselves. And in that journey, they wanted to well, they want to provide whatever it is, but it's much bigger. If someone is interested in just one thing, I think we all have a competitive drive, for example. So when I look at people, I'm trying to understand, and this is a little bit what I'm trying to explore, and the current podcast we're doing with all this super appletes, what's driving your competitive spirit. And I've kind of honed it down.
Starting point is 01:30:48
And again, I played the Rises from somebody. But you're either driven by competing and killing a competitor. Think of Muhammad Ali or somebody like he needed to see the other person stand over them. You're driven by fear failure. I just interviewed an erotic in the first episode of this podcast. And you can tell he's like, listen, I was driven completely by fear failure. I just interviewed Annie Roddick in the first episode of this podcast, and you can tell he's like, listen, I was driving completely by fear. But what you see is the first person is a warrior.
Starting point is 01:31:12
And the warrior, unless they evolve, they know they'll lose the last battle. And therefore, they quit. And you see it in some of that inbox and they come back for one more, and that's when they lose and whatever. The person that is motivated by fear eventually taps out out of exhaustion. And the more successful that they become, the harder the fall, they're like, I got to run. And I see a lot of friends of mine who quit at 48, 50, 52 when they have all this gas in the tank.
Starting point is 01:31:41
And I realize that many of them are driven by fear or failure. And they just don't want that. The value of success is so much less than the pain of failing that they can't take the trade anymore. The success became too significant. The third, and where I'm like really focused on is, is the people that love to compete because they just love to get better all the time. It's a race
Starting point is 01:32:05
against themselves. One is a good race against somebody, the other one is a race against fear, the other one is a race against yourself. And I find people that have that energy have a better balance about it and can run the longer race. And if you see people like I know lots of guys that are in their 60s or 70s that are still refusing to let the old man or old woman in is because they're driven by the game by getting better. Professionally how much of your energy is into your business versus your philanthropy? Not time but energy.
Starting point is 01:32:37
It was say we're a percent six years ago, it's probably 15% now. Going to go to 30, eventually it will be 50. What do you want to accomplish philanthropically that you have not yet accomplished? Not just necessarily at scale. Is there a problem that you have not yet gone after? Because A, you haven't acquired the knowledge, B, you haven't thought of the angle at which you can have the most leverage, but there's a problem that's nagging. Again, because there's no winning, you're just advancing something forward.
Starting point is 01:33:09
I am very motivated by reversing a bunch of the trends in Puerto Rico. I'm not going to solve Puerto Rico. I made barely do anything, but I think I can do something to start reversing some of the trends. I think the bigger opportunity I see is how the companies become a force of good. How do business leaders see themselves and their responsibility to be a force of good in their communities? I think this platform's their businesses are so powerful, not just monetarily, but as engines of people
Starting point is 01:33:38
and problem solving and access to opportunities that I want us to become a bit of a beacon of like, wow, you can be successful and be good at the same time. And they don't have to come against each other. Do you think that public companies can do that? Is that part of your decision to stay private? I just, I don't like authorities, so I hate having a stock ticker on my head,
Starting point is 01:34:00
so that's why I don't wanna be public, but I, I think public companies today, this is a Milton Friedman kind of challenge and Simon talks about it in that book. my head. So that's why I don't want to be public, but I think public companies today, this is a Milton Friedman kind of challenge. And Simon talks about it in that book is shareholder at the center. That's changing. Look at what the business council just announced in the last couple months. Hey, there's a bunch of stakeholders here. This are pendulums that swing. When we get a fairly far left precedent in our country, a lot of this stuff may change. And so this are pendulums. This is not new.
Starting point is 01:34:28
What challenges you the most in your business today? You get a great challenge. You play basketball. It's still such a huge part of your life. You are so competitive with yourself in basketball. What are you trying to sharpen your sword in business? I mean, you talked a little about negotiation. Obviously, I can sense in you this passion to be better and better and better at that and to understand the relationship and the dynamic because obviously the best negotiation is one and when both people win. What other skills are you honing?
Starting point is 01:34:55
The answer you may not like, but I feel like I'm over my head right now. This is so much fun. I'm like trying to run the matrix. We are in seven industries from financial services to health care to entertainment. We're building a lot of tech and I'm not a techie and we're a techie company. We have 800 engineers and I'm not in anything. How many total employees right now? 3,200. We have 200 employees in London. We have 110 in Brazil. So you had to know countries, you know, got to know markets. And most challenging is we grew organically for a long, long time.
Starting point is 01:35:28
So we were almost like a culture of settlers. So you came through our system and we've done a number of acquisitions and now we become a culture of immigrants. And when your culture is your competitive advantage, which I think 100% it is, and you have added so much newness to it, and leading our 100% it is. And you have added so much newness to it and leading our way through it is really challenging. And I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm like, for as gump.
Starting point is 01:35:51
I just show up everything. I give it a really all my effort and I can't get fire, which is good. And if it goes to zero, it goes to zero. I don't care. Somehow I wouldn't bet on that. No, for sure. I am 100% sure that if red ventures went to zero. No, no, no, I'm not sure
Starting point is 01:36:06
I'm going 30 days. I'll be super happy to go to zero. I'm found purpose and something else and none of this stuff Well, it matters for a few people who can say that with more certainty than you But of course, that's probably exactly why it doesn't happen. I'd certainly bet against it If you go back to the morning of Thursday January 15th, 2009 and you could run into yourself as he's leaving his hotel rushing to the airport, and you couldn't tell him what was going to happen, but you could say anything to him, what would you say? Don't miss that flight. That was the most remarkable, remarkable gift I ever got. And I feel bad. There's people that were on that flate that
Starting point is 01:36:46
will never fly again. I know there are people on that fly that still can't sleep well. And I am really sorry for that. I'm really lucky that the way it landed in my system was it gave me urgency, it gave me purpose, it gave me humility, it gave me a game to play, which is a game with no regrets. Rick, I can't thank you enough. I don't know what I did deserve two hours of your time today, but you've given a great gift to a lot of people. And honor to be here. You are one of a kind. I learn so much from you every time and thank you for being my friend.
